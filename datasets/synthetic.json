The only \nissue with startup and shut down emissions is that they get counted toward \nyour total emissions for the year, and you certainly covered this issue in \nyour last paragraph to question #1.\nThe revised file is attached.\nGus",

(Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, \nand second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the \nvaluation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, \neveryone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of \nthe second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation \nbidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation.

The strategy for countering this situation \nhas been Washington based and two pronged - utilize the lenders, especially \nOPIC and EXIM which are both USG agencies, to drive an effort to call on the \nTurkish Treasury guarantee, and to mobilize the US government as a matter of \npolicy and in the context of the IMF funding to insist that the Turks clean \nup their energy sector.  Both elements of the strategy have been recently \nsuccessful with the consequence that about $60 million has been paid over the \nlast several weeks.  I anticipate as the strategy plays out over the next \nmonth to six weeks we should see payments of an equivalent or greater \namount.  Since my office has the relationship with OPIC and EXIM we have the \nlead across the government on this issue.  We also anticipate that there will \nbe some work on the Spanish and Polish projects in the future. \n In light of all of this perhaps we should increase Europe's allocation.  \nJust a thought!

If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the \npremium swap as the \"first transaction\"  and the discount as the second.  \nThis will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the \ncalendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have \nto look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  \nHaving the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would \neliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I \nwill check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product \ndescription would have to be written such that any customer would be easily \nbe able to determine the correct direction to trade.  \nI will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get \nback to you .\nThanks \nPete",

I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of \nthe factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.\nI moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named \nPresident of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop \nto the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was \nabsolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with \nvery little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's \nbottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading \nand risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create \nliquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.  \nSo our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help \nbuild revolutionary new businesses.\nWhat a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk \nmanagement presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our \noutstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These \nbusinesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different \nvariables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage \nin Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't \nput gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other \ncommodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to \nfigure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if \nyou like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down \nhere! .... we need you!\nJohn's callout quote\nEnron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't \nfit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll \nexcell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.\n    ",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is \"Energy curtailed\" \n(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message \"Turbine Com Established\" (Index = \n10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a \"Energy \ncurtailed\" message (Index = 11134).\nIs there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment \nmessages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established \nmessage was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no \nmessage was recorded? \nThanks,\nMark",

He \nsuspected bad news.  I told him he was terminated.  He is expecting to meet \nLilian on Monday, with her providing the paperwork.  I have told him, per my \nconversation with Lilian, that he should direct questions regarding COBRA, \netc., to Michelle in Houston, as Lilian eschewed familiarity with some of \nthese nuances of US employment law.  We had a 30 minute conversation, he had \nlots of question, I have taken copious notes in the event of any subsequent \nlegal issue arising (I do not expect any based on my conversation).  He was \nquite surprised/shocked.  He asked about work in train.  I asked him to do a \nlist on Monday of projects in motion, with a list of contacts, e.g., law \nfirms/consultants, which he will do (Lilian - not sure what usual practice \nis, but David wants to leave on a positive note, so he wants to leave his \nwork in progress in good shape; therefore, please accommodate him so that he \nmay at least complete these tasks on Monday, i.e., do not show him the door \nat 10 a.m., thanks).  I said I would have to get out there to pick it up, \nwithout mentioning that Kristina and I have discussed plans to meet in \nSingapore very soon to resolve staffing/resourcing to support EBS Asia.  \nPlease let me know if you need more or have any questions.\nLilian - please arrange for the Singapore switchboard, as of Tuesday a.m., to \nindicate that David is no longer at Enron, and to redirect any business calls \nto David, to Jan Haizmann or to me, as we will cover the regulatory \nrequirements until a replacement is found.  Jan's number is 44-207-783-4474, \nyou have my number.  The time zone difference is unfortunate, but this will \nhave to suffice for now, and in this way Jan and I can attempt to get our \nhands around any issues hanging out there with regulators or consultants.   \nthanks  mcs",

Don't\nmiss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  See\nmeeting details below.\n**********************************************\nHarvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum\n=01&Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence=018\nDinner and Discussion Club\nJoin us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk\nsubstantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid\nthat your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in\nthe conversation?  We have the solution.\nModeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole\nSpakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard\nForum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow\nclub members.\nThe format works like this:  we=01,ll have dinner, and then a panel of Harv=\nard\ngrads will give brief introductions to the evening=01,s topic from their\nperspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in\na large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be\nknowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They\nwill, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is\nlively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than\never - maybe better than you ever wanted.\nThe topic we=01,ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our\nchildren may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than\nwe enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What\npractical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the\ncharacter values that we treasure?\nWe plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.\nBecause of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated\nbelow.\nWhen:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.\nWhere:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)\nCost:      $35.00 per person\nReservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084\n(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing\ncheck to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)\nFor further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or\n713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or\n713-665-4218).\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nDottie Kerr (harvardclub@kerr-solutions.com)\nAdministrator for Harvard Club of Houston\nwww.harvardclubofhouston.org",

The drop \nin frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may \nchange the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the \nnetwork is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion \ndevices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.\nThe second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker \nis involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will \ncause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network. \nTransformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many \nmiles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point \non the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the \nsolution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made \nmore simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed \n(i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a \nDSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure \nto be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be \nsourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !\nWill send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.\nKarl.",

(\"EPMI\") are parties to a Confirmation Letter dated December 20, 1999 (the term of which has been extended by letter dated __________________) under which EPMI has been purchasing energy for resale to MPC or selling energy received from MPC into the wholesale market.  As you are no doubt aware, the FERC issued an Order on June 19, 2001 that imposes new restrictions upon wholesale energy sales throughout the WSCC.  \nOne restriction that affects our agreement is that marketers, such as EPMI, may not sell energy at prices above the price cap set by the California ISO (\"California Cap\").  Generators are permitted to sell above the price cap if they can justify their prices.  As a result, at times (such as during this week's heat wave which caused blackouts in Las Vegas) EPMI may not be able to purchase energy anywhere in the West at a price below the California Cap.  Because EPMI cannot pass through costs of purchasing energy above the California Cap to MPC, we cannot purchase such energy on MPC's behalf for resale to MPC.  \nHowever, in order to continue to serve MPC's needs at times of peak demand, scarce supply, and high prices, EPMI proposes the following solution:\n1.\tIf EPMI is unable to acquire energy at a price at or below the California Cap, EPMI will strive to meet MPC's energy needs by arranging for a generator to deliver energy to MPC and for MPC to pay the generator directly. \n2.\tEPMI will notify the seller that it is purchasing the energy on behalf of a customer, who will be paying the generator directly for that energy.\n3.\tEPMI will notify MPC of the identity of the seller, along with the amount to be paid the seller, and provide other information and assistance to enable MPC to pay the seller directly. \n4.\tAll other aspects of the existing agreement will remain unchanged.\n \n\tWe believe this proposal allows EPMI to continue to meet MPC's needs, while complying with Federal law.  If you have another proposal, or would like to discuss this matter further, please feel free to call either Christian Yoder at (503) 464-7845 or Steve Hall at (503) 464-7795.  \nOtherwise, kindly acknowledge your understanding and agreement to this amendment by signing in the place provided below.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tENRON POWER MARKETING, INC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tName:  \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTitle:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\nAccepted and Agreed \nThis _____ day of July , 2001.\nMONTANA POWER COMPANY\nBy:  \t\t\t\t\t\t\nName:  \t\t\t\t\t\nTitle:  \t\t\t\t\t\t",

This can only happen if the asset is not \nhedgeable, and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the \noption pricing.   If you assume that the underlying is a non-traded factor, \nthen the PDE will have to reflect the market price of risk, and the drift of \nthe actual process is then reflected in the PDE.\nVasant\nZimin Lu\n10/17/2000 05:20 PM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant \nShanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alex \nHuang/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Kindall/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya \nTamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Option Pricing Challenge\nDear All,\nI have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95.    Hope you can give \nme a convincing answer .\nZimin\n---------------------------------\nIn deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM\nds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz\nwhere mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.\nThen we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation \nfor the option price, regardless\nof mu.  \nWith the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No \nproblem.\nQuestion comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows, \nsay, mean-reverting process\nds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz\nApparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However, \nusing the delta hedging argument,\nwe still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary \ncondition, we get the same BS formula.  \nNot fair !\nFrom another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the \nunderlying, which is the lognormal distribution.\nMy thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE \n?  The answer should be yes, but got to be\nfrom a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the \ndelta-hedging argument ?\nThanks. ",

Deal with seismic company was done by a Mark Peterson who is still with \nEnron.  I haven't caught up with him for details but it had to do with \nunderwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey.  Timing is important.  \nInterest may have picked up in new surveys and the survey company decided \nthat they didn't need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no \nsales.  \n2. 3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E & P activity or \nbe spurred on by successes in a given basin.  While activity continues in the \nGulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the \ndeep water.  Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and \nworked for years - they were accessible with the extraction technology of the \ntime.  I don't think that deep water sedimentation /depositional systems were \ncompletely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water.  \nConcepts have evolved quite quickly.  The point is that many deep water \naccumulations are incredibly large - billion barrel accumulations.  These \nsizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies \nwere drilling surface structures.  The large reserves are needed to pay for \nthe corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development.  \nI believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to \nthree times shelf f & d costs in the Gulf of Mexico.  This differential is \nprobably large with international projects (and that doesn't take into \naccount political risk). \nI'll look forward to more involvement if and when this project /concept goes \nforward.  Feel free to forward this to all participants.  \nGreg\nBob Lee@ENRON\n13/10/2000 08.30\nTo: Gregory P Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Reichardt/Enron Communications@Enron \nCommunications\ncc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Seismic Data via satellite\nI am preparing a summary or our Thursday discussions to be used as a \nbackground piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders.  I will \ncirculate this for review/correction later today, or ,at the latest, Monday.\nGreg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in \nthe Gulf of Mexico that was successful.  It might be useful to get more info \non this.  Terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not \ncontinued to do this, etc.\nAlso, from your comments, many, if not most of the 3-D surveys are in deep \nwater.  I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep sea \ndrilling/extraction project in the Gulf.  What oil price is required to make \nthese kinds of projects viable financially?\nBob Lee",

My recollection is that the 25% was used as a \nbenchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule.\nECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the \n$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the \"re-negotiated\" rate \nschedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.\nIn any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it \nis reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in \na more timely manner.\nDave Foti\nx.31978",

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\nAcquiring a Company\n\tIn the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,\nand so on.\n\tThe board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price\nthey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\nthe press.\n\tThus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\nanything less than $50.\n\tAs the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's\nstock?\n\t$______ per/share",

Canadian Natural Resources;\n2. our form based upon the form entered into with Canadian Natural Resources; \nand\n3. the form recently prepared by Mary Cook in Houston with respect to PG&E \nexposures.\nIn my experience, these agreements are difficult to put in place for various \nreasons, including:\n1. the asymmetry of various issues between the existing governing physical \nand financial master agreements;\n2. multiple counterparties, both on the Enron side and on the counterparty \nside, with multiple obligations affecting different physical and financial \ncommodity positions; and\n3. drafting (i.e., when you get into drafting one of these agreements, since \nboth the physical and financial master agreements tend to be \"tightly\" \ndrafted and rely heavily on \"defined terms\", marrying concepts relating to \ncalculation of exposures, termination amounts, performance assurance, and the \nlike, can be very difficult).\nIn short, these agreements are not easy to put in place, but I do believe \nthat in the appropriate circumstances they are worthwhile.\nI would think your best starting point may be the precedent form of Master \nNetting and Collateral Agreement that I have referred to as item #2 above.  I \nspent some considerable time on that document and believe it would be the \nbest starting point.\nRegards,\nPeter\nFrom: Chris Gaffney on 02/22/2001 11:33 AM EST\nTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peter Keohane/CAL/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Atlantic Packaging (Atlantic)\nMark/Peter - Enron Canada (\"ECC\") is contemplating entering into physical \ntransaction to supply power to Atlantic.  It is contempated to be a 3 year \ndeal for 25-50 MWh and will be back to backed with the British Energy supply \ncontract.  ENA currently has an existing pulp and paper swap with Atlantic \nwhich was done under an ENA/Atlantic ISDA.  Enron credit has reviewed \nAtlantic and has advised that in order for ECC to do the power deal it will \nneed to put into place a master netting and collateral agreement.  I have \nreviewed a form of master netting and collateral agreement that ECC has used \nwhere there is a master physical and an ISDA between the same two parties but \nnot where there are three parties.  Do either of you have such a three party \nform?  I was thinking we may have this in Houston to the extent we have \nentered into this type of arrangement in power deals (i.e. among EPMI, ENA \nand the counterparty).\nThis issues that arise in the current situation are complex given that:\nGoverning Law - the physical agreement will be governed by Ontario law and \nthe ISDA is likely governed by New York Law.  the master netting agreement \nwould likely be governed by Ontario law;\nSharing - there will need to be a concept of sharing/obligations between ENA \nand ECC (for all situations, both in the money, both out of the money and one \nof each);\nCurrencies - Not overly complex but will need to be addressed as betwee ENA \nand ECC as well as with the counterparty.\nIf either of you have any thoughts on the contemplated agreement please let \nme know.\nRegards\nCJG\n ",

Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels \nper day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel \ndeliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between \n10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was \nbooked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced \nconsumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual \nlosses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters \nworse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they \nare going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is \nlinked through the end of 2001.\nTo properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, \nwe need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was \noriginally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of \nthe deal.\nIn addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, \n2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per \nconversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level \nfor the foreseeable future.\nTo properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the \nDubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately \n$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and \ncost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to \nrefine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.\nOn a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout \n2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to \njustify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed \nabove (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that \ntheir next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is \ngoing to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas \nbefore they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently \ndiscussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.\nPlease call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can \ngive us in this matter.",

Here are my responses:\n1.  Yes, this is primarily a tax issue.  However, there are some countries \nwith strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those \nissues with specific PA provisions for those countries. \n2. No.  Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that \nonly the first time they trade that product.  The GTC's are arranged by \n\"Product Type\" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - \nregardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to \nthe financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of \nswaps and options you subsequently trade.\n3. No.  But if that would be helpful it can be arranged.\n4.  This one doesn't make much sense to me.  EnronOnline itself doesn't make \nany money.  There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the \ntrades are all done by the various Enron trading entities.  EnronOnline is \nactually providing them a service.\n5.  I really have no idea.  I guess we would have to print out the records \nand have one of the IT people testify that they had not been modified.\n6. So far we haven't deleted anything.  If we need to keep the records for a \nlong time we probably can but this has not been discussed.\n\tBrent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n\t06/08/2000 11:36 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Mark Taylor@ECT\n\t\t cc: Andrea Calo/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\n\t\t Subject: EOL Survey\nTwo of the internet attorneys at Marval came over today to look at the system \nonline.  They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer \nto.  Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?\n1.  They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of \nthe password application that prohibits the user form using the password \noutside their country.  I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but \nwas not sure.\n2.  They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC \neach time they transact a trade.  I believe each product is represented by a \nseparate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought \nseveral related products will probably have identical GTCs.  I told them I \nthought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that \nfor each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have \nreviewed, you must accept the GTC again.  Is this correct?\n3.  Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for \nuse of the system?\n4.  They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. for \neach product could be considered \"content\" for EOL and be considered value \nfor which EOL should pay the trading entities.  I haven't heard of this issue \nbefore but I said I would ask.\n5.  As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic \ntrade?  How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the \ndata.  How would the data be presented to a court?  \n6.  How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are \nthey retained?\nAny help you can give me would be appreciated. \nThanks,\nBrent",

What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey?\n? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract?\n? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price?\n? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a \nretrade)\n? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary \nservices get accounted for in the \"cost\" calculation?\n? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit \nor a cost?\nRegarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues.  First, what is \nthe methodology?  Rick is very close to having a stack model that \nincorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, \nVOM, etc.  Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for \nrunning the model?  This process will need to be documented every time the \ncalc is performed.  Third, what is the timing of the calc?

I know he asked many others as well.  Here is what I told \nhim:\nThere is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines.\nNEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else \nwe raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others.\nUnder the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not \nbe a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long \nas they are not buying or selling gas.  On the flip side, if the new \naffiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing \nAffiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are \nmet.  I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001 \nsuch that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject \nto the marketing affiliate standards of conduct.  If the success of NEWCO \ndepends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last \nvery long.\nMost significantly, when the new affiliate wants to resell/trade its capacity \nrights, it will have to do so through the pipeline's capacity release rules.  \nThe new affiliate can arrange pre-arranged transactions of less than 30 days, \nbut any other deals would have to be posted for bid.   But, I don't think we \nshould be scared off just because the deals would have to go through capacity \nrelease.  NEWCO could do less than 30 day releases at above max. rates on a \nprearranged basis.  NEWCO could also do 1 year of less prearranged deals at \nabove max rate,  they would just have to be posted to see if anyone wanted to \nmatch the deal.\nThe crux is that there is no regulatory prohibition standing in the way of \nsetting up a new affiliate, but it is important to figure out what the new \naffiliate's objective is.  \nIf the point is to capture short-term, above max rate deals without going \nthrough a negotiated rate posting, then we may follow a fairly simple \nstrategy of setting up a limited NEWCO to buy and sell capacity only.  \nIf the point is to \"churn\" capacity trading, then the issues are essentially \nthe same as those involved in setting up bid/ask trading on EOL.  \nIf the point is longer-term, total energy type of deals, then we just need to \nunderstand that the new affiliate will be a marketing affiliate.\nYou ask what is being done to further this idea.   I think we need some \nclearer marketing vision of how NEWCO plans to make money (through above max \nrate deals in capacity release?  through rebundled deal? ) before  a more \ndefinitive list of regulatory steps can be developed.\nSteven Harris\n12/01/2000 12:26 PM\nTo: Shelley Corman/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \nSubject: New Marketing Company\nShelley,\n I know Danny talked to you a while back about us creating a new company to \nhold capacity on other pipes, etc. What ever happened to that idea?

It has been four years\nsince the first edition was published. During this hiatus,\na lot has happened as risk management within the\nrapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as\na respected discipline. The second edition is a rich\ncompilation of papers by a surprisingly representative\ngroup of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.\nThe books strength is that it reinforces the fact that\nrisk management principles initially applied to a narrow\nband of energy commodities can and should be applied\nacross a wide array of energy commodities including\nelectricity. As expected the book does a solid job in\ncapturing an international perspective on the various\nchallenges, which are not isolated to any one\ncontinent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy\nintroduction that effectively frames risk management\nprogress, advancements and innovations that started\nin the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the\nnatural gas and most recently expanding to the\nelectricity industry.\nManaging Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15\nchapters, all of which include an introduction, which\nminimises the disjointedness that you may expect from\na book written by a large number of authors. Other\nimprovements in this second edition include expanded\ngraphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a\nseparate glossary, which provides the reader with\nadditional reference material.\nIn particular the chapter on energy options written by\nMichael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the\nreader with a concise explanation of option theory,\npricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical\nguidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure\nspeculation. For the more advanced reader, the\nchapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince\nKaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is\nparticularly strong as it outlines the challenges\nassociated with the exotics and effectively documents\nthe latest methods used by leading practitioners in\npricing such instruments.\nAdditionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative\nContracts in the Energy Environment by three\nconsultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written\nsummary which addresses the numerous tax related\nissues including a timely discussion on the US Financial\nAccounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see\nEPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax\ninformation housed in one concise chapter is of great\nvalue.\nThe second edition however is not without flaws. In\nparticular, it would have been useful to have more\ninformation on the current challenges risk managers\nare confronted with in the power industry including\nlatest advancements in volatility and correlation\nestimation techniques. Additional attention could have\nalso been placed on the shortcomings of the current\nmarket structure and methods in finding and applying\nappropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the\nfledgling power market, this continues to be one of the\nprimary challenges.\nIn summary, this second edition of Managing Energy\nPrice Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the\nprior edition and is a valuable reference book for the\nnew recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome\nedition to any risk management library.",

The price goes to \n$100.  \nYou lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise \ngives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes\non your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is\n28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against\nordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. \nOf course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option \nposition\nas an offset.\nThe remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the\ntax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have \nincome in the\nfuture (or capital gains).\nNot so good.\nBy the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options\nis a very interesting and difficult problem.\nVince\nChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON\n07/10/2000 11:40 AM\nTo: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: short-sell vs exercise\nBelow is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It \nexplains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised \nbut cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call \noption before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the \nordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good \narticle anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)\n-chonawee\nShort-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options\nIn general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when \nyou speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In \nfact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never \nreach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or \nuntil you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold \non to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your \nexercise.\nHowever, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of \nexercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that \namount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, \nyou can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On \nthe other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the \noptions to cover your short position anytime. \nLet us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, \nand zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as \nfollow\nIf you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, \nyou would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no \nmatter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover \nthe short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of \nshort-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can \ncover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your \noptions or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still \nkeep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the \nonly sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your \nshort position.",

This is truly a\nremarkable speech.\nFORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTION\nThe Independent (UK)\n6 October 2000\nInternet:\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Environment/2000-10/ford061000.shtml\nThe 100-year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming to\nan end, Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday. It\nwill soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell, which\nemits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the build-up of greenhouse\ngases causing climate change, Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the company's\nfounder, Henry Ford, told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London.\nIn a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer, in which he proclaimed\nhis\nown environmental credentials, Mr. Ford, 43, accepted that the automobile\nhad\nhad a serious negative impact on the environment, and that his industry had\nwrongly played down the threat from global warming.  And the head of the\nworld's second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he\nsaid\nthat he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars, but\nmerely have access to mobility.\nDetroit-born Mr. Ford, who has been chairman since the start of last year,\nproclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing the\nworld and that anyone who disagreed was \"in denial\". Ford itself had moved\non\nfrom that position, he said. But he felt the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 pact\nin\nwhich the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission of\ngreenhouse gases, would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global\nwarming.\nOnly the marketplace, making new technology widely available, could tackle\nthe problem.\nA fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in\na\nbattery: it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricity\nand water vapour. It does not run down or need recharging, working as long\nas\nthe hydrogen fuel is available, but most importantly, it does not produce\nany\nCO2, the basic by-product of any carbon-based fuel such as oil, gas or\ncoal.\nEvery major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developing\nthe technology: Ford is spending $1bn (?690m) between now and 2004, while\nDaimler-Chrysler, regarded as the leader in the field, has spent $700m. All\nthe main manufacturers have prototype fuel-cell cars running and there is a\nrace to bring them to market. Honda and Toyota expect to do so in 2003,\nwhile\nFord and Daimler-Chrysler are aiming at 2004.\n\"I believe fuel cells will finally end the 100-year reign of the internal\ncombustion engine,\" Mr. Ford said, adding that the technology was \"the holy\ngrail\" of the motor industry. Prophesying the demise of car ownership, he\nsaid:  \"The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership is\nantiquated,\" he said. Mr. Ford was reflecting advanced motor industry\nthinking, which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of\ntheir\nown if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire\nnetwork.\n - UK Environment speech.doc",

We still have a few binders with\nthe presentation materials available if you are interested.\nWe plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall.\nThe first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general \nconcept of real options\nand their applicability to the energy business.\nThe second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used\nto model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case\nstudies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired \npower plants).\nThe real options approach has been developed specifically to address the \nproblem of making\ninvestment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this \nis a\nperfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other \ntechniques developed\nearlier.\nDiscounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through\nanalysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely, \noptimistic,\npessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers\nand don't specify the future proactive management decisions.\nThe real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture\nuncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that\nallow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to \ndownside risk.\nThis approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and \nfuture\noperational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options \nthat are exercised\nin the future through active management of a project.\nThe real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to \ncome\nup with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real \nchallenge is\nto use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30 \nyears\nof applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants \narmed with \npowerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The \nchallenge is not\nto run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions\nbut to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand \nspecific  businesses\ninto parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to \nstress-test the assumptions\nof any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends \ncritically on any set of assumptions.\nIf this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying \nassumptions.\nI remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the \ndynamics of oil prices,\nbut all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very \noptimistic  upward trend.\nOne would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question \nwhat Economics 101\nteaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Erin Rice @ ENRON                           06/27/2000 03:52 PM\n\t\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Pre-submitted question on eSpeak\nGood news!

Candidate models should be described\nmathematically and verbally.\n4.   Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly\nidentified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation\ncriteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,\nAkaike information criterion.\n5.   Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The\nestimation procedure employed should be briefly described.\n6.   Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.\n7.   If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.\nGenerally, the case study should include all of the items above. The case\nstudy may include other things.",

The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.\nI'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:\nCustomers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. \nIn short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.\nCustomers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  \nFor example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.\nI believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.\nIn addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.\nWith this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.\nFinally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?\nLook forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the \"core/noncore\" proposal.\nBest,\nJeff",

I was thirsty, we=\nnt=20\nto the bathroom a lot, started not feeling well and then finally I lost a t=\non=20\nof weight real fast. When I went to the Doctor my blood sugar was nearly fi=\nve=20\ntimes normal.=20\nSince August 3rd, my life has changed a lot.  I was told when to eat, what =\nto=20\neat, what NOT to eat and how much to eat. Which is pretty tough to do=20\nespecially at Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day and Easter=\n. =20\nMom paid me for my Halloween candy and took it to work, so that was a good=\n=20\ndeal.  I was told that my genes contained a code for killing the insulin=20\nmaking cells in my pancreas and that all that code needed was probably a=20\nvirus that I had had last spring to turn it on. My insulin making cells are=\n=20\ngone forever but they tell me that someday they hope there will be a cure.=\n=20\nSince I was diagnosed, every day I test my blood at least four times for=20\nsugar and take insulin shots three times a day. I have given myself nearly=\n=20\n1,000 shots and have poked my fingertips for blood nearly 1,400 times and i=\nt=20\nhasn=01,t been even a year!  I would love to be normal again and there are =\na lot=20\nof other people that have diabetes that I=01,m sure you know feel the same =\nway. =20\nSo, I am writing to tell you about a project I am working on this year call=\ned=20\n=01&Walk to Cure Diabetes=018.

We can amend the LLC Agreement  if necessary, but\nit seems burdensome since the title is only a formality.  However, as\ncurrently written, the Commercial Development Manager is the person\nresponsible for managing the daily business, i.e. similar to a desk\ndirector.  In order to maintain control of this position, it can only be\nfilled by an Enron nominee and will report directly to the MEH General\nManager, Laura Luce of Enron.\nSection VII:   Majority of the wording came initially from attorneys, I\nwould recommend confirming that.\nResponse:          I will run this by the attorneys.  However, from a\ntechnical perspective, Section VII refers to employees of MEH.  No one in\nthe Chicago office is an employee of MEH, but rather we all remained\nemployees of our respective organizations.  I will ask the attorneys if we\nneed to limit all Chicago based employees, both of Enron North America and\nPeoples Energy Resources.\nSection VIII:  Who is the General Manager of MEH?\nResponse:          As mentioned above, Laura Luce, Vice President of Enron\nNorth America\nIs Enron North America Corp. a legal entity?\nResponse:          Yes, Enron North America Corp. replaced Enron Capital\nTrade and Resources as the Wholesale business of Enron Corp.  Unless you\nknow something different, I believe that to be a true statement.\nLet me know if any of my responses don't make sense or you still have any\nquestions.

Simultaneously, the \nstate government has also agreed to look into the possibility of scrapping \nthe revised power purchase agreement signed by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP \ngovernment on December 9, 1998, with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC).  Talking \nto newspaerson on the eve of the winter session of the state legislature, \nwhich starts on Monday at Nagpur, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed \nthis and added that the project, which was envisaged to tackle the power \nshortage of the stat, seemed to have defeated its purpose because of its \nprohibitive costs which the consumer may have to bear.  \nThe constituents of the DF government, comprising the Peasants and Workers \nParty, Janata Dal (Secular( and the Communist Party of Inida (Marxist) have \nbeen pressing for the cancellation of the Dabhol project on the grounds that \nit would impose further financial burden on the ailing MSEB and ultimately on \nthe state government, which is also reeling under severe financial crunch.  \nThese allies were of the view that the scrapping of the PPA will not be a \nmajor issue as such agreements with multinationals have been scrapped in \nPakistan, Turkistan and Indonesia.  \n. . . .\"\nThe team is assembling tomorrow morning at 9:00 at DPC to talk strategy.  \nAttached is talking points I wrote up after working with Mohan Gurunath of \nDPC and Ananda Mukerji (EIPL -- Finance) and Jimmy Mogal (PR).  I sent around \nfor others to add their input.\nQuery whether the CM's statement is actionable repudiation.  Paul Kraske \n(attorney for DPC) is looking into it.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on \n11/27/2000 12:10 PM ---------------------------\nJimmy Mogal\n11/26/2000 08:45 PM\nTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Wade \nCline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc:  (bcc: Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT)\nSubject: Mah CM says Phase II under review\nThis piece has just appeared as \"breaking news\" on Cafe Mumbai dot Com, on \nthe net.

The rate of electricity produced also \ndepended on the dollar-rupee ratio so also the international prices of NAPTA. \nAs such, there were chances that the rate of electricity could go up to as \nmuch as Rs. 20/- per unit. This would prove to be very exorbitant for the \nconsumer in the state. \nThe CM has now asked MSEB to go into the details of the agreement between the \nstate government and Enron. He also indicated that his government was\npreparing the legal grounds in case Enron took it to court if the agreement \nfor the second phase was finally scraped. -cafemumbai Report \n \n ",

I will be interested \nin the responses you get.\nRegards,\nMark\n\tPeter Keohane\n\tSent by: Sharon Crawford\n\t11/07/2000 04:17 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris \nGaffney/TOR/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT, Rob \nMilnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, mhb@blakes.com\n\t\t Subject: Security under Master Agreements\nMark, Rob Milnthorp has asked me to consider whether there is an artful way \nunder our Master Agreements that upon certain occurrences we could elevate \nour exposure from unsecured to secured, particularly in circumstances where, \nfor whatever reason, we have not received letters of credit or other \ncollateral.  My thought is to insert a clause in our Master Agreements in the \nnature of a \"floating charge\".\nThe problem with this concept is that it may be resisted within the \nindustry.  For example, certain counterparties, i.e. a financial institution \nor a near-financial institution, such as a bank, a brokerage, a trading \ninstitution, etc., would not likely be willing to provide us with security \nover their assets.  In general, counterparties will also have concerns with \ngranting security over their assets, particularly as that security may have \nrestricting consequences for their treasury/banking relationships and \ncovenants, and/or on their ability to conduct business, including disposing \nof assets which may then require our consent.  In addition, it would likely \nbe necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis, such that it \nwould also be binding on us in similar circumstances.  (Counterparties could \ngo so far as requiring this concept in our Enron Corp. guarantees.)\nFor example, in the natural gas business in Canada at least, older form \nmarketing agreements and agreements used by gas aggregators with gas \nproducers used \"reserved dedication\" covenants, whereby reserves were \ndedicated to a particular contract.  These covenants did not, however, create \nsecurity, to avoid the complicating issues addressed above.  To the extent \nthat the reserves were not available, the marketer/aggregator could have a \nclaim, on an unsecured basis, for breach of covenant, but was not in a \nsecured position.  I do not believe we want to go to this type of concept.\nHowever, we may be able to think of some creative way whereby the \ncounterparty is free to deal with us (and we are free to deal with them) on \nan unsecured basis, subject to our standard collateralization requirements, \nbut also provide that upon the occurrence of a particularly serious event, \nsuch as a Material Adverse Change, a Triggering Event, an Event of Default, \netc., the security automatically takes place.  We would need to consider \nwhether such a \"prospective\" security interest could be made to work and be \nenforceable.\nI have discussed this concept on a preliminary basis with Rob Milnthorp and \nMungo Hardwicke-Brown of the Blake firm to see if we could create a \nrelatively simple clause to be inserted into our Master Agreements which \nartfully deals with this issue.  In essence, the idea would be to get \nourselves in a position of being one step ahead of all of the unsecured \ncreditors in the event there is an insolvency.\nWould you please let me know whether you think this is a worthwhile project \nor whether we have considered such a thing in the past in Houston.  As noted \nabove, the clause would have to be one that could be \"sold\" to counterparties \nand be acceptable to us on a bilateral basis (and that may well not be \npossible).  If you believe that it is a worthwhile project, I will continue \nto work with Mungo Hardwicke-Brown to see if we can come up with something.  \nIf you do not believe that it is a worthwhile project or have considered this \nidea in the past and found it to be unworkable, please let me know, and we \nwill not work on it further.\nRegards,\nPeter",

Disagree about the demand \ndestruction. \n? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- \nPacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are \nunderestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy \nis less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is \nchanging. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power \ndemand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on \nwhat the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying \nis  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries \nwill increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure \nin service industries.\n? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have \nimagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly \nentrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. \nAlso they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50\n?

When asked the implication for missed earnings and their \nplans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the \nbright lights business'\n? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom\n First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much \nworse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates \nthis week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar \nwhich will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will \nnot tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction \nin big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this \nis not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming \nmore service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the \nwhole story.\n?

The message below is from Ron \nNolte, our IT person\nfor the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent \nquestions that may need your\nlegal opinion.\nI guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and \nset-up of EOL's discussions\nwith HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT on 10/19/2000 10:26 AM \n---------------------------\nRon Nolte\n10/16/2000 12:37 PM\nTo: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Torrey \nMoorer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Johnson/Corp/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \nSubject: City Streets\nJust came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey \nMoorer informed everyone about the new venture \nbetween HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 \ndays, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered \non EOL.\nI solicit comments from everyone.\nAs I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto \nHoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will \nmagically appear. The party might think, \"Hey, I can't do better than this on \nEOL, I'll take this deal\".  The deal is transacted   \nand HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the \"Do the Deal\"  \nbutton is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where\nit is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party \ndoing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.\nIn the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and \nTAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:\n  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #\n  EOL Deal #\n  Sitara Deal #\n  TAGG Deal #\nBased on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in \nTAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using\nHoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.\nIf you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using \nHoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.\nThis requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I \nassume ) will need to be changed to capture both\nthe HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is \nassigned by the Capture program.\nThis will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was \nassumed that there is only one \"Originating System\")  program modifications \nto TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( \nclears Power deals ).\nNow for some issues:\n1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the \nconfirmation?  Whichever Enron entity  offers that product on EnronOnline \nwill be the party for these trades as well.  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and\n a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  \n There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information \nis set up based on who the external party is doing business with.\n In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information \nset up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will\n have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.\n2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com \nlogo? No.  The confirms may reference the platform on which the trade was \ndone but otherwise it should look just like a regular Enron confirmation.\n3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?  \nSame process as exists for EnronOnline transactions.\n4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under \nEOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If\n new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, \nthen contracts will have to be set up\n between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes \nthrough EOL, how will the appropriate\n contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, \nis  a different contract assigned \n in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself? Seems to me it \nshould be the same - we only have one agreement with Koch.\n ",

I've met the Fuel \nCell folks, but have not met anyone with CRRA yet.\nCurrently, I'm preparing a letter of intent for Enron/CRRA for the \npurchase/sale of the cells, have a development agreement prepared by outside \ncounsel to review, and need to come up with a draft purchase agreement for \nFCE to review. I'll make sure Dan is in the loop on as much of that as he \ncares to read.\nI've heard a rumor of an issue regarding the authority of CRRA to purchase \nthe equipment (perhaps relating to the use of bond money for the purchase), \nbut haven't come up to speed on that issue yet.  I would like to chase down \nthat issue some more before a loud alarm is sounded, however.  \nI'll get a grasp on the hearing protocol, as I know Dave is very interested \nin that aspect of the process.\nKay\nDan Lyons@ECT\n09/25/2000 03:23 PM\nTo: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron \nSubject: Re: FCEL  \nWith respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you:\n1.

Cle Dade and I are going to look at it \nwith respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.\n2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am \naware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on \nthat draft, but nothing has been signed.\n3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the \ninitial draft of the \"talking points\" for the disclosure discusison. It is \nnew and has not been discussed internally yet.\n4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity \nhave been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is \nhandling the \"State\" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo \nto advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.\n5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the \npurchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will \ndepend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we \nwill probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not \nknow what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and \nagain request Kay to please advise us on that.\nIt seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with \nthe team on this, but I defer to your judgment.

There needs to be an action items which I thought was started two weeks ago to ensure that everything which is needed by CSC on the Deal Ticket is captured by us on our deal tickets so we can on populate a deal ticket once.

It looks like there may be some key personnel we want \nto employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not \nreally familiar with the specific facts here.\nThe question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract \npersonnel like its own -- by setting compensation, controlling their \nactivities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and \nother ways in which an employer treats its own employees.  So, if the plan is \nto have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an \nemployee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a \nsupervisor.  Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.\nIf there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers \n-- and like workers are treated similarly -- the risk may be reduced.    It \nis cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting \nagency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other \nalternative).  Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people \nwho may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk \nof the contract workers.\nI would like additional information on this situation before reaching a \ndefinitive conclusion.  So, let's try to discuss it.

We discussed how \nthe employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are \ninfact agency workers.  Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other \nemployees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get \napplicable benefits.\nThe other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should \nbecome Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.\nHe realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly \"muddied \nthe water\" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or \nthe agency.  He was not involved with the original decision to grant these \nemployees Share Options.\nWe discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the \nspecific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals \nEnron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy \nthing to do.  \nHowever, this is his ideal scenario.  How viable is it that we can do this \nfor him?\nHe also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath \nInc. and is one of his most valuable employees.\nRegards\nMelissa",

It seems to me like a long \nterm project. Chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than \nthe Australian Met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and \nthat they are an \"old boy's network\"  resistant to new developments, but I \ndon't think the same can be said of most other weather services. As far as \nthe NWS goes, they run their model on a Cray, they have several very talented \nPhD's working on it full-time,  and even then, they can only get a dozen or \nso runs per night. In other words, it's a huge system. Replicating something \neven close to that will not be an easy task. \n That being said, I think there are related applications that we could look \ninto.  Since I've already promised the RAC group and the weather desk's PJM \ntraders to put together a Vector AutoRegressive model of daily temperatures, \nI think it makes sense to see if something better than a VAR model can be put \ntogether, perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model Christian \nhas. What I have in mind is something  that would give us say, up to several \ndozens of \"possible\" temperature forecasts every morning, which would be \ncalculated using actual climate models (as opposed to time series models). I \nwould not use this as a forecasting tool (the NWS model results would make a \nfar better  \"best guess\"), but our ensemble could still be used to provide a \ndistribution of temperature scenarios. This ensemble would have several uses:\n 1) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a \nmore realistic daily V@R for the Weather Book (and eventually interface that \nwith the power desk's V@R calculations)\n 2) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to \nweek-ahead CDD and HDD distributions (for use in our demand swaps)\n 3)  if Freese-Notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts, \ne.g., \"expect the trough to recede\" we could sort through the different Monte \nCarlo scenarions, find one in which the trough in question is receding, and \nuse corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures \ncorresponding to that scenario. Up till now, we haven't found a good way of \ngetting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean \ntemperature-wise\n 4) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such \nmodels to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns. The \ntraders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly \nmatch current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen; \nalthough these meteorological models would not be good for simulating \nmonth-ahead or season-ahead weather (trust me on this) we could still use the \nvisualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations.\n Just today, I've spoken with Dr. Jacobsen of Stanford University, who has \nwritten one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who \nworked with UCLA's general circulation model.  He says that getting a \nsimplified version of MM5 (which is itself a simplified, limited-area version \nof the GCM models that NWS, COLA, and UCLA use) would take several months to \nimplement,  assuming the people involved are already well versed in the \ntechnology. Also, I have contacted AER, a Massachusetts- based weather \nconsulting firm, and they tell me that they have a MM5 model running daily \n(only one run per night), and also some smaller PC models up and running. \nThey are of course willing to work with us for a fee. Their MM5 version runs \non a $200,000 parallel processor.\n I am open to your suggestions (or objections as the case may be). I'm not \nsure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of \nEnron, and not just the weather desk.\n I am scheduled to go to Boston next week anyway, and would like to use the \nopportunity to visit with AER. I will of course coordinate any projects with \nChristian (if we get something like this up and running it will be more \nlikely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own Australian \nmodel).\nJoe",

Babbitt\nSubject: Disclaiming Insurance\nConnie,\nI think we finally decided how much money we want to disclaim for purposes of funding the trust. \nWe will not be diclaiming the house but will try to disclaim two life insurance checks, an ADD through Jimmy's employer, Marsh & McLennan, and held with CNA and the credit card Travel Accidental Death Insurace held through American Express. I will be talking to the Larry Harman about the process of doing this. It will add about 450k to the estate and take the probate assets up to about 1.4M or 700k for the trust.\n[Connie L. Babbitt]  That sounds good.  There are always complications when a personal residence is put in a disclaimer trust, so I believe you are making the correct decision there.  \nIs there any deadline or timelines on when the trust must be setup? \n[Connie L. Babbitt]  No, but the disclaimer must be filed with the probate court by June 11, 2002. \nIs there a form to send to the IRS to request a tax ID for the trust?\n[Connie L. Babbitt]  Yes, an SS-4 Form.  We can prepare one for your mother's signature. \nMy mom wants to know if we need to meet with you or when?\n[Connie L. Babbitt]  I would like to meet with her.  I think she will be more comfortable if she's had a chance to meet me personally, although it's certainly not required.  I visit many of my clients at their home, so I could meet at her house if that would be more convenient for her.  She may prefer a meeting fairly soon to answer any general questions she may have about the estate, trust funding, and distributions of assets.  If our firm will be preparing the 2001 income tax return, I would also need to meet with her to obtain all the 1099s, W-2s, etc for the 2001 return.  A meeting around the end of January, beginning of February would probably be good timing for that.\nWhen will we find out what those new regulations will really mean for our estate income taxes?\n[Connie L. Babbitt]  Once I see the 2001 1099s, W-2s, etc and get a better grip on all the income sources, we ought to be able to zero in better on the issues.  At first blush, I would anticipate very little tax liability for 2001.  I'm hoping the IRS will be issuing further guidance to address more details, e.g. spousal income, etc, over the next few weeks.  I'm sorry I can't give you a more definitive answer on this one.\nThanks,\n \nGeof\n \n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

The price goes to \n$100.  \nYou lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise \ngives you $30,000. This is before taxes.

It \nexplains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised \nbut cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call \noption before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the \nordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good \narticle anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)\n-chonawee\nShort-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options\nIn general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when \nyou speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In \nfact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never \nreach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or \nuntil you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold \non to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your \nexercise.\nHowever, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of \nexercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that \namount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, \nyou can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On \nthe other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the \noptions to cover your short position anytime. \nLet us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, \nand zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as \nfollow\nIf you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, \nyou would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no \nmatter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover \nthe short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of \nshort-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can \ncover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your \noptions or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still \nkeep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the \nonly sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your \nshort position.",

Also, please note that \nour accounting group has also blessed this agreement.\nAs a summary, the substantive changes that I made are as follows:\n- Article 1 now more specifically describes the standards by which Trinity \nwill perform its services (these changes should be a non-issue)\n- Article 3 now imposes certain conflict of interest obligations on Trinity.  \n3.1 obligates them to represent and warrant that their entry into an \nagreement with us will not breach any other obligations that would otherwise \nhave to other parties.  3.3 imposes the obligation on them to obtain our \nprior consent before they perform any work for any third party or government \nagency that would have \"an adverse effect\" on us (this is direct change from \ntheir form which had no such obligation but which is standard in our \nconsulting agreements and is a reasonable request.) \n- Article 4 adds our standard language that Contractor is an independent \ncontractor and not entitled to any of our employment benefits.\n- Article 5, inserted a 2 year term.\n- Article 6 inserted that payments are within 30 days and that reimbursements \nmust be in advance.  Please note that since I cannot edit the Price Schedule, \nthen conforming changes to it need to be made, including whether to strike \nthe 18% interest charge for late payments and whether to accept the 15% \nout-of-pocket surcharge (neither of which is in our standard agreement).  I \nalso inserted your name for invoices.\n- Article 7 added a termination event that the breach of the conflict of \ninterest or confidentiality obligations is an immediate event of termination.\n- Article 8, inserted your name for notices with a copy to me in the legal \ndepartment.\n- Article 9, I revised the liability limitation to make it reciprocal and \nexcluded from the liability limitation, damages that would arise from \nTrinity's breaches of Section 3.1 (that entering into this agreement will not \nbreach any other agreements that they have), Article 10 (indemnification for \npersonal injury or death claims attributable to them), Section 12.2 (not \nproviding us with information that violates someone else's intellectual \nproperty rights) and Section 13 (non-disclosure / confidentiality \nobligations).  Note that although accepting a liability limitation is not \nstandard per our agreements, by making the foregoing exceptions, the \nliability limitation that we are effectively agreeing to is only with respect \nto any \"malpractice\" claims that we would have against them if their work was \nnot up to industry standards.\n- Article 10, this is an indemnification provision which obligates them to \nindemnify us for personal injury or death claims attributable to them.\n- Article 11, states that the ownership of work product developed will be \nours and that they will not provide us with any information etc. that they do \nnot have the intellectual property rights ownership of.\n- Section 13.4 are certain procedures to be observed in the event that a \ncourt requires the production of confidential information (the text is \nstandard boilerplate.)\n- Article 14 states that they have all liceneses to perform the work and to \nthe extent that any are needed they will obtain them at their own cost and \nexpense.\n- Article 15 is our standard boilerplate.\n- Formerly Article 12 on Non-Solicitation of Employees - per our discussion \nthis has been struck\n- Section 17.1 now imposes venue in Harris County, Texas not Dallas County.\n- Section 17.2 allows us to assign the agreement to any of our affiliates \nwithout their consent but subject to notifying them of the assignment\n- Section 17.8 requires our consent before they use Enron's name in any \nadvertising\n- Exhibit A terms and conditions have all been struck since those duplicated \nwhat was in the Master Agreement.\nPlease call me with any questions that you may have or let me know how I can \nbe of further assistance.\nClean Copy\nBlackline Comparison",

There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.

Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.

I agree that we must do something quickly \nto resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as \nan extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very \nhappy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that \nyou got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you \noffered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that \nmomentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most \ndon't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I \nhave learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we \nwait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to \naccomplish with their guidelines.\nPlease keep me up informed on this matter.\nThanks and good luck with the students.\nmike\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           10/02/2000 07:13 PM\n\t\nTo: Charlene Jackson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Celeste Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns\nWhile recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made \nat the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In \ntalking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University \nof Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an \ninternship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for \nsummer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her \nmanager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay \ninterviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's \nstaffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the \npractice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more \nconcerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would \nseem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern \ninterview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for \nEnron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for \nour Analyst and Associates programs.  \nI have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with \nno resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either \nconfirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  \nSenior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley \neither did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do \nso.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this \ncritical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms \nthat will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   \nAnd based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring \ntop students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for \nthese positions this fall.  \nWhile my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, \nI want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all \ncampuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the \nprogram, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to \ncarry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation \nto make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must \naddress this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on \ncampuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I \nsuspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of \nthe Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer \ninternships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive \nsponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the \ndecision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this \nnote to the two of you. \nPlease let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner \nand others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that \nshould be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time \nas is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative \nways to turn this around.  ",

I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if\nI come back.\nYour plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is\ncome out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a\ndebauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should\nbe fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By\nthe way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.\nPlease check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does\nthis routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his\neyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at\nhim.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.\nHope all is well in sunny Portland.

Also, please note that \nour accounting group has also blessed this agreement.\nAs a summary, the substantive changes that I made are as follows:\n- Article 1 now more specifically describes the standards by which Trinity \nwill perform its services (these changes should be a non-issue)\n- Article 3 now imposes certain conflict of interest obligations on Trinity.  \n3.1 obligates them to represent and warrant that their entry into an \nagreement with us will not breach any other obligations that would otherwise \nhave to other parties.  3.3 imposes the obligation on them to obtain our \nprior consent before they perform any work for any third party or government \nagency that would have \"an adverse effect\" on us (this is direct change from \ntheir form which had no such obligation but which is standard in our \nconsulting agreements and is a reasonable request.) \n- Article 4 adds our standard language that Contractor is an independent \ncontractor and not entitled to any of our employment benefits.\n- Article 5, inserted a 2 year term.\n- Article 6 inserted that payments are within 30 days and that reimbursements \nmust be in advance.  Please note that since I cannot edit the Price Schedule, \nthen conforming changes to it need to be made, including whether to strike \nthe 18% interest charge for late payments and whether to accept the 15% \nout-of-pocket surcharge (neither of which is in our standard agreement).  I \nalso inserted your name for invoices.\n- Article 7 added a termination event that the breach of the conflict of \ninterest or confidentiality obligations is an immediate event of termination.\n- Article 8, inserted your name for notices with a copy to me in the legal \ndepartment.\n- Article 9, I revised the liability limitation to make it reciprocal and \nexcluded from the liability limitation, damages that would arise from \nTrinity's breaches of Section 3.1 (that entering into this agreement will not \nbreach any other agreements that they have), Article 10 (indemnification for \npersonal injury or death claims attributable to them), Section 12.2 (not \nproviding us with information that violates someone else's intellectual \nproperty rights) and Section 13 (non-disclosure / confidentiality \nobligations).  Note that although accepting a liability limitation is not \nstandard per our agreements, by making the foregoing exceptions, the \nliability limitation that we are effectively agreeing to is only with respect \nto any \"malpractice\" claims that we would have against them if their work was \nnot up to industry standards.\n- Article 10, this is an indemnification provision which obligates them to \nindemnify us for personal injury or death claims attributable to them.\n- Article 11, states that the ownership of work product developed will be \nours and that they will not provide us with any information etc. that they do \nnot have the intellectual property rights ownership of.\n- Section 13.4 are certain procedures to be observed in the event that a \ncourt requires the production of confidential information (the text is \nstandard boilerplate.)\n- Article 14 states that they have all liceneses to perform the work and to \nthe extent that any are needed they will obtain them at their own cost and \nexpense.\n- Article 15 is our standard boilerplate.\n- Formerly Article 12 on Non-Solicitation of Employees - per our discussion \nthis has been struck\n- Section 17.1 now imposes venue in Harris County, Texas not Dallas County.\n- Section 17.2 allows us to assign the agreement to any of our affiliates \nwithout their consent but subject to notifying them of the assignment\n- Section 17.8 requires our consent before they use Enron's name in any \nadvertising\n- Exhibit A terms and conditions have all been struck since those duplicated \nwhat was in the Master Agreement.\nPlease call me with any questions that you may have or let me know how I can \nbe of further assistance.\nClean Copy\nBlackline Comparison",

Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank\nyou for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.\nAs I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for\nMarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your\nconsideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire\nbundled product, which includes\n? North American gas, short and long term\n? North American electricity, short and long term\n? World gas\n? Western European gas\n? World oil\nWe are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western Europea=\nn\ngas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into\nMarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of\nmonths.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are\npresently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an\nattractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout\nyour worldwide business.\nAs I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil=\nl\nwant to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at\nthe meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately=20\n the fully\nbundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the\nsoftware licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the\nelectric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas\nmodel plus the data for=20\n the software license plus the data license for a\ntotal of $55,000 annually.  This is just under=20\n the fully bundled price.  I\nthink that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from\nMarketPoint=01,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward\ntogether with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to =01&scale up=018 to =\nanother\nmodel or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you\nup to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the ga=\ns\ndecision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put\nthis additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move\nforward.)\nI felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of ou=\nr\napproach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you\nmight need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you\nwere able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam=\ne\ntime its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the\nbenefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a\ncomplement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I\nwould be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I\nlook forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as\na very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to\nearn and secure your business.\nIf you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount\nMarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest yo=\nu\nbegin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1=20\n day training seminar.\nOur clients are usually very fluent after that 1=20\n day training seminar.\nThereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a\nfew weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable\nbefore you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks\nlater.\nThanks again, and all the best.

I think your points are valid and had \na few thoughts that might help to clarify.\nThe State Department and UK Foreign Commercial Office developed these \nprinciples with the intent that the principles would serve as broad \nguidelines, general enough to apply to any company in any industry.  As you \nwill note, with the exception of the title, the principles are general and \napplicable to any company involved with hiring security to protect an \nfacility and/or asset - be it in the U.S. or otherwise.\nI agree that we may need to distinguish ourselves from the typical extractive \nsector participant.  Should we agree to support the principles, I suggest \nthat we draft the letter so that it  distinguishes Enron from the other \nparticipating companies. The letter (and maybe Dept. of State) could also \nnote that Enron is the first company outside of the extractive sector to \nsupport these principles.  This would go a long way in demonstrating our \nleadership on the issue of human rights.\nAlso, we may want to consider that while we may be exiting the asset \ndevelopment business by selling our pipelines and power plants, we are taking \nequity positions (albeit minority and/or short term) in industries that do \nfall into the category of extractive industries such as coal and metals.  To \ndate, we have already received inquiries about our activities in these \nsectors, particularly in the coal sector.\nWith respect to public accountability, we will continue to be criticized for \nnot being accountable in this area unless we take some policies steps in this \narea.  Our stakeholders and \"critics\" are aware that we do not have policies \nand procedures addressing security arrangements.  In addition, they are aware \nthat we have participated in this discussion and dialogue because it is our \nintent to strengthen our human rights policies and performance.  Until now, \nthe weakness in our critics' arguments (with respect to India and otherwise) \nhas been the lack of benchmarks and/or guidelines with respect to this \nissue.   However, once these guidelines are public, it will be difficult to \nmaintain the position that there is a lack of consensus on the issue.\nA risk we should consider:  should we decide not to support the principles, \nthe NGOs and others will be asking us why we have not adopted these/and or \nany guidelines.  These guidelines are particularly attractive because they \nhave been developed in collaboration with government, industry and NGOs - \nrather than by one particular interest.\nI hope this is helpful and look forward to your feedback.  I am in the \nWashington office today, but can be reached on my cell at 917-821-0724,\nThanks again, \nLauren\n   \nFrom: John Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 11/13/2000 02:02 PM\nTo: Lauren Goldblatt@ECT, Kelly Kimberly@Enron Communications, Mark \nPalmer@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\ncc: Steven J Kean@EES, Vicki Sharp@EES \nSubject: Security and Human Rights Policy Question \nWe are finishing the legal comments to the Security and Human Rights paper \nthat Lauren Goldblatt circulated for legal review, and will finalize it today \not tomorrow.\nBefore get the detailed comments out, however, there is a threshold policy \nissue that needs to be considered:\nThese guidelines expressly applicaty to the \"Extractive Industries\", which \nare typically thought of as the mining and oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment industries. The companies listed as cooperating with the UK and \nUS governments and the NGO's in producing the principles do not include Enron \npeers.  Enron has only one unit that is engaged in that economic sector, and \nthat unit is being sold  right now. None of Enron's other units are in what \nwould normally be referred to as an extractive  industry.\nSince that is the case, we wonder if Enron has made an appropriate level \npolicy decision to publicly endorse these principles and make them corporate \npolicy when the company is energetically exiting its only remaining business \nline that is in the express industrial peer group targeted by the \nprinciples?   At first I understood that such a decision had been taken, but \nVicki and I wanted to confirm that before proceeding.\nThere are two major concerns:\nEndorsing the principles would would identify Enron more closely with the \nmembers of a particular peer group that Enron is consciously exiting and \ndistingushing itself from.  \nOnce Enron endorses the principles, the fact of that endorsement, the \nresulting  public \"accountability\" for the principles,  and the consequent \nneed to demonstrate compliance will become essentially a permanent feature. \nOnce endorsed, it would be nearly impossible for the Company to distance \nitself from the guidlines. That being the case, should Enron at this juncture \nendorse the guidelines when it could do so later if it ever makes a committed \nre-entry into the extractive industry?\nAre there other security type principles that are more appropriate to or \nfocused on our new core business lines, or the remaining asset ownership and \nconstruction lines that Enron should be looking at instead?\nPlease call either me at 713-646-6309 to discuss. You can also call Vicki \nSharp at 713-853-7413.\nThanks.",

I have arranged for box \nlunches to be served after the meeting.   After the meeting, we will have the \nremainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner \nserved that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD).  \nBlock of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs.  \nI will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I  would like \nto know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting.   \nShuttle Service -  See attachment for shuttle times.  Please note, a return \nreservation from the hotel to the airport is required.  Please contact the \nConcierge to arrange for shuttle service.\nColorado Weather - For the month of June, you can expect the \nfollowing:         \nHigh's - 80.............Low's - 52\nFlights from Houston - I have checked with TAP for roundtrip flights from \nHouston - Denver, Denver - Houston and an exceptionally great \n(non-refundable) fare of $190.94 is available.

Teamwork is the name \nof the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades.  Continuous \nclass III and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over \nNomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the \nOuter Limits.  Good physical condition and the ability to swim are \nrecommended.  The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will \nreturn to the Omni by 6:15pm.\nChautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for \nmountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the \n100-year-old dining hall.  The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the \noriginal Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands \ndotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 1900s. \nThe tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of \nguided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours.

Spectacular \npanoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 400 feet \nin elevation changes.  If this is the activity of choice please respond via \ne:mail and I will add you to the list.  The game of choice will be \"best \nball\" play.\nBiking -  Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with \ninterest.  If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will \nreserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.\nAfter reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to \ntake part in.  Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it \nmore difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask \nthat you not change your selection.

He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of \nhis efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.\nJoao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he \nis key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know \nfolks but he also gets things done within the system.\nValeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.\nDaiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the \nyear after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times \nabout her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to \nrelations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that \nare still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.\nLucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He \nhas been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the \nproject successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project \nfrom the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.\nTwo other people that are not involved in \"our side\" of fence on a daily \nbasis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.

Gelber chose to\nend the telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber\ncalled Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of\nthe necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August\nwe received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer\nspread.? However,  on the month of July the price received was not only\noutside of the then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher\nthan the NYMEX high for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the\nCitizen's Arizona Gas price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340,\nthe high for the day on NYMEX was  $5.290.\nI do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My\nassessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is\nmy understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your\nbusiness relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices\nup when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.\nCitizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for\nsecuring fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.\nSincerely,\nArt Gelber\nGelber & Associates\nagelber@gelbercorp.com\n713/655-7000",

The result=\n has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western E=\nurope in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expande=\nd and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consume=\nr market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially =\ngiven that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and r=\ne-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can=\n assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  =\nThis is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES=\n, EES risk and Enron Networks.\nIn that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes =\nwhich demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the c=\nreation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.\nA)=09EES Europe:\nEffective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES E=\nurope.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES busi=\nness model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side managem=\nent to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke wil=\nl manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has c=\nontinued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided signific=\nant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid a=\nnd back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large co=\nnsumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode w=\nho will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our pe=\nnetration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with =\ncompleted contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of th=\nese transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would l=\nike to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of th=\ne European franchise.\nWe are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group=\n led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products a=\nnd services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North Ame=\nrica, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are co=\nntinually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the E=\nuropean business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity betw=\neen gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed=\n to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business t=\no differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe co=\nmmodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to C=\nharlie, Paul and Roy.=20\nAs part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal =\nManagement in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES=\n from many years and we believe she has all the experience and skill sets t=\no effectively manage and build on this integral function in EES USA.\nB)=09Enron Direct USA - Dealer Network\nEffective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel in=\nside Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated=\n agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numero=\nus \"dealers\" across the US.  This dealer network will consist of small know=\nledgeable entrepreneurs and consultants that have been in the energy market=\ns for many years and have great regional expertise and customer relationshi=\nps. EES will provide a franchise like program where we provide resources an=\nd products to this agent base in exchange for exclusive provision of sales =\nservices and customer aggregation.  We hope that this network can provide t=\nhe customer acquisition velocity and low cost acquisition model benefits of=\n the mass market agents but provide a more sophisticated agent in front of =\nlarger clients in order to sell higher value products that include gas, pow=\ner and DSM.  Phyllis Anzalone and her team are already working on the devel=\nopment of this dealer network and will become part of this group reporting =\nto Stuart.  Phyllis and her team deserve a lot of credit for the identifica=\ntion and build out to date of this newest business model in EES.\nIn conclusion, everyday we are getting better and more effective.  We shoul=\nd be very pleased with the financial and operating performance of EES for 2=\n001.  We have an EBIT target of $75 million for Q4 which is only $4 million=\n higher than Q3, We will finish the year at approximately $247 million.  Th=\nis is approximately 10% over 2001 plan and 120% growth in recurring earning=\ns year on year.  The business model is working and we are one step closer t=\no the goal of becoming the leading global energy retailer.  The All-Employe=\ne meeting will be on November 1 where we look forward to discussing with yo=\nu our operational and financial results for 2001 and our plan, strategies a=\nnd objectives for 2002.",

Mark\n\tMark Greenberg@ENRON\n\t12/13/2000 11:10 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Rob Walls/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: eLaw and eVelocity\nRob/Mark -\nI wanted to give you both a brief overview of the reviews this past week of \neLaw and eVelocity.\neLaw - I met with principals of eLaw and Steve Horn earlier this week.  The \nreason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron \nto the tune of $10MM to $15MM.  The secondary focus was on the product and \nits usefulness to Enron. Steve made it clear that any funding decision would \nbe driven 100% by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and, \nthus, it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go.\nThe demonstration of the tool was impressive.  Though it does act as a \ntraditional shopping type site in many respects, it also has functionality to \ncreate a \"myelaw\" page customized to the information you, the user are the \nmost interested in seeing.  It also allows for a query into further \ninformation, which query is then forwarded to the law firms (or firm) \nsupporting the practice area (e.g. Labor/Employment) for comment.  There is \nalso the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics \ndeveloped by Enron retained firms can be loaded, organized and maintained, \nincluding legal opinions, memoranda on various topics and form \npleadings/documents.  This area is secure from the balance of the site so \nthat other users cannot access the information.  The loading process is \nfairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment.  Some \nof the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a \nnew version coming out early Q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to \nhave at least 10 or so practice areas available.  Right now the focus is on \nEnvironmental, Intellectual Property, Health Care, and Tax.\nI think the tool could be useful, especially in relation to the organization \nof information we obtain from our outside sources.  It may also complement \nthe website/portal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the \nwebsite/portal development process.  I would be curious to see, however, what \nother tools are out there doing the same or similar function.\neVelocity - I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs (sp?) to discuss the \neVelocity tool.  It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm \nand our legal department solely for the movement, review and payment of law \nfirm invoices.  While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a \nmatter management system, it can, itself, be used as a matter management tool.\nThe capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of \nrules that are applicable to law firm invoices.  For example, say Enron does \nnot pay more than $0.10 per page of copying.  This can be set as a rule so \nthat any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than \nthis amount per page would be automatically rejected.  The rejection would \nthen require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to \nthe system.  This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so \nthat the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review, but notes that \nit is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney \nis alerted to the issue.  The system does identify the problem so you do not \nhave to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules.  It is \npossible to  establish rules that would allow an invoice, presuming it \ncomplied with all rules, to be automatically approved and moved to AP for \npayment.   This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system, but it \ncould be done.\nIn addition to the above functionality, the system can also track matters, \nbudgets for matters, costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm \npeople who are authorized to bill against a specific matter.  Reports can be \ngenerated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a \nbudget or overall costs for various matters.  Finally, since it is a \nweb/browser based system, implementation is not difficult and there is not a \nlot of IT involvement needed.\nI specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed \nand received the response that there really is no such need.  Mike indicated \na pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up.\nIn keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS, \nas well as similar ideas presented for the Corp. portal/website, it makes \nsense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that \ngoes beyond litigation tracking.  Whether or not it is eVelocity or another \ncomparable tool would require further research into the available products, \nbut I believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program \natmosphere.\nWhat I have provided above is a general overview of the products and meetings \nsurrounding the demonstrations.  If either of you would like further \ninformation or have any questions, please let me know.\nMark\nSenior Counsel, ENA\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3940\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com",

I have some questions regarding Enerfin.\nWhy are we re-allocating prior month volumes at Enerfin after we matched your \noriginal numbers back in October? Can't this be fixed in the actualization \nprocess?  \nThe numbers for October between ENA-TETCO and HPL vary a good bit.  Are we \nyour only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ENA had \nno transactions with HPL?  Can we simply put zero paths in UNIFY and extend \nour existing deals in Sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize \nthese small volumes to handle this?  We go round and round at this point \nchanging volumes two, three or more times. Call me if you have questions..  \nThanks Victor\n---------------------- Forwarded by Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT on 12/14/2000 \n08:50 AM ---------------------------\nFrom: Meredith Mitchell on 12/14/2000 09:28 AM\nTo: Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: HPL discrepancy  \nVictor,\nThe sitara ticket that we were using for the month of October is #421415.  \nTETCO shows that the volumes that HPL was allocated on October 6th and \nOctober 19th, were 9 dths and 44 dths, respectively.  Those volumes were \npulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in \nplace.  This is the same problem that we have had over and over with them.  \nAlso, we just found out on Tuesday, that the OBA did not go into effect until \nDecember 1, 2000.  We were originally told that they were putting the OBA in \neffect retroactively to November of 1999.  In fact, I thought that HPL had \nmade a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the OBA, do you \nremember that?  HPL told us that Ray Calles at TETCO is the one who decided \nthat the OBA would not be effective until December of 2000.  Nobody even \ninformed us of this change, I stumbled upon it when researching a November \nissue for Alfonso Trabulsi and Brenda Fletcher.  In addition to all of this, \nI received another email, which I will copy below, asking me to go in for the \nmonth of October and adjust all of my estimated volumes in Unify to match \nwhat HPL shows that we were allocated.  I had been going in all month long \nand matching to their numbers, and we were clean for the deadline at the end \nof the month.  I ran the allocation report from TETCO for the month of \nOctober, and some of HPL's numbers were very different from TETCO's, \nincluding the two days that I mentioned above.  I sent Jackie Young an email \nback showing her TETCO's numbers and I haven't received a response.  I will \ncopy that email below as well, just to catch you up on what's been going on.\nJackie Young\n12/12/2000 10:01 AM\nTo: Cynthia Franklin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Meredith Mitchell/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sherlyn Schumack/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Estimated Volumes for meter 98-0439 for (10/2000)\nCynthia/Meredith:\nPlease find below the estimates for the above referenced meter for 10/2000.  \nOnce you're done placing these estimates on TETCO's side, can you please \napprise me so that volume mgt. can conclude their business?\nThanks\n-Jackie-\n3-9497\nDAY\tVOLUMES\n1\t39647\n2\t40040\n3\t39643\n4\t39809\n5\t39702\n6\t18 dec.

I copied your numbers below and \ncopied TETCO's volumes below that (with the disrepancies in red).  I was \nwondering if you could double check the 3rd, 4th, 11th, 12th, 25th, and 27th \nto see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than \nEnron North America at that meter.  It looks like maybe the volumes that you \nshow are the total flow at that meter, but I think that only part of the gas \nwas actually allocated to us.  I don't mind putting the allocated volumes in \npath manager, but I'd like to make sure that on the above days, I am only \nputting in the amount that Enron was allocated.   \nAlso, on the 6th and the 19th TETCO shows exactly half of what you show, \nwhich I thought was kind of strange.  I am going to have to get TETCO's \npermission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes \nyou have requested, before I can put anything in Sitara or Unify.  My manager \nis out of the office and will be back tomorrow, but I would like for him to \ndouble check the deal that we will have to create in Sitara for those two \ndays, since we are dealing with a prior month issue. \n \nDAY\tVOLUMES\n1\t39647\n2\t40040\n3\t39643\n4\t39809\n5\t39702\n6\t18 dec.

Such a trip requires an  explicit prior \npermission from your boss,\nmyself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence.\nIn case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request  is denied.\nVince\n\tClayton Vernon @ ENRON\n\t07/20/2000 03:12 PM\n\t\nTo: Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: status\nVasant-\nI hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered \nfrom the long flight back.\nI wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my \nintentions here at Enron.\nSoftware (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged \nto listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In \naddition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on \na continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a \ndynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how \nthe software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit \npurposes.\nThese data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for \nwhich I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines \nelucidating the structure of the data.\nI am in the process of documenting all of this for you.\nWith regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has \nagreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if \nthe performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been \nresearching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine \nwill be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be \nable to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is \nCompaq-specific.\nI am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.\nI've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not \nonly the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the \nother day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there \nwasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In \ndiscussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power \ntrading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were \nubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they \nhave complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also, \nthere remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; \nduring my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to \nhow to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time \ndata harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with \"well, we \nhave it, but we haven't really tested it yet.\" An example is the weather: we \nstill do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES \nsatellite.\nMy interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only \nif Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the \nEnron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the \nareas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the \nResearch Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people \nat Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't \ndirectly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, \nexcept in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.\nAs it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting \nperson, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to \nGeorge Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are \ninterested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their \ntraders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with \nKevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were \ndisgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They \nalso understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid \non a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all \nwork for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but \nmerely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years \nas a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a \nstate-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me \nthey will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, \nincluding hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to \nteach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I \nhave learned here.\nSo, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be \na lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you \nin any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL \ndatabase. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their \ndocumentation.\nAs it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, \nand will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by \nemail, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data \nwarehouse for floor trader support.\nClayton.",

I \nwas still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at \nthat point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:\n review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London \nbooks to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the \nissue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change \nsystems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process \nand tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, \nnew activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of \nbooks on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process\nAlso I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at \nsame time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market \nrisk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure \nreporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this\n to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for \nLondon counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are \ndoing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) \nWould defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues \ntrying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals\nI would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on \nWednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for \nMetals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be \nthe presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.\n discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your \nbusiness controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep \nreviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to \ncontinually improve the process), \nWould like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, \nself assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a \nsmall group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome \nsome more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be \nsuccessful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your \n'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators\n discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office \nrelated to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR\nAs explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the \nimplementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross \nprioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark \nand Fernley on this would be useful\n do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in \ncalendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )\n discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London \n - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it\n discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around \npotential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a \nsection of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I \nwould like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence \nof vision/strategy documentation for CL\nLead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note \nthis is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-\nChanging Market practices\ncreate cashflow messaging within each transaction\ncreate payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and \nliquidation \nre-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes \nto terms of trade\nModule/Application developments\nSynergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation \ntogether )\nelimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic \nmessaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of \npayment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at \nliquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )\n \nIn addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you \nthink would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael \nBrown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also \nspend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan \nto meet with Fernley as well.  \nAny other suggestions on topics or people to see?  Can I suggest we also \ncover \nRemote offices with Naomi Connell\nThe ledger control process - similarities and differences with Houston\nStatic reference control processes - ( Global \nCounterparties/Companies/Contracts/Facilities etc )\nThemes from our business process reengineering reviews prior to Christmas - \nsimilar to bottom up Op risk assessment\nA gap analysis for the risk management team - explaining the 'legacy' work \nthat James New has been leading on \nOur plans for EAS in Europe \nI shall call to discuss / prioritise and then I can instruct Fiona to \norganise meetings\nMike\n  \nI think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above \nbut would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?",

Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership \nissue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a \nleadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.  \nThis means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step \nback and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond \nScott for policy and technical guidance).\nI'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at \nour EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about \nindividual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the \nmoment are:\nPeople need to realize that individual success does not happen independently \nof the success of our group as a whole.\nThis means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to \nwork constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions.\nDecisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional \nmembers and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the \nnature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside \nfor you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group \nsteps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings \nthat you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.\n Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they \nare focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative \nimpact on their performance reviews.\nI really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please \nlet me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these \npetty issues.\nHow's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so \nI'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with \nour lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine \nregulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to \nmake them.

You \nknow this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is \nimportant to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  \nI suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable \nand familiar with the issues.\nTherefore, two requests.  \nWould you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as \"DC Office\"?\nAlso -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple \nof times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM \nissue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these \ninitiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a \nleadership role.\nSorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just \nbetween the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior \nDirectors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority \nladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and \nmaybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.\nHappy as always to discuss.\nMuchas gracias,\nSteve\n----- Forwarded by Stephen D Burns/Corp/Enron on 05/31/2001 10:43 AM -----\n\tEric Benson\n\t05/30/2001 05:16 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Scott Bolton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Stephen D \nBurns/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Allison Navin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lara \nLeibman/NA/Enron@Enron, Margo Reyna/NA/Enron@Enron, John \nNeslage/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron@Enron, \nMichael Grimes/AP/Enron@Enron, Jan Haizmann/ENRON@EUEnronXGate, Vinio \nFloris/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kikumi Kishigami/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t cc: Sue Nord/NA/Enron@Enron\n\t\t Subject: EBS Government Affairs Regulatory Report for May 2001\nTo: Distribution\nFrom: Eric Benson\nAttached for your review and input is the draft EBS Government Affairs Report \nfor May 2001.

I need the contract in POPS for August \nforward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.\nIn 1998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South \nTexas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-62210-101 and a Global number \nof 96016880 by Karen Lambert.  Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by \nDan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.  In 1999, when Copano began \nallocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and \nyourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.  Karen sent me an e-mail \nindicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase - \nGlobal # 96022367 (I don't have a \"Synergi\" contract number).  I know that in \n3/99 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.\nI need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so \nthat I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.  I have not allocated \nany line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.  Karen is the most \nknowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be \ndirected to her regarding contract issues.  Karen worked with Bernard Widacki \nat Copano to set up the contract originally.\nThanks,\nFred",

The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the \nassignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC \nmember interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice \nprovided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to \npurchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern \nCorp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests \nis that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If \nENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a \nreturn of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. \nThis structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in \nJanuary, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the \ndate of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract \nassignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to \nthe assignment and sale of the member interests.\nThe earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, \nnotwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very \nminor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement \nand Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase \noption with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have \nhad to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform \nunder its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior \nto the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our \npurchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our \nagreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are \nperfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be \nrecognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated \nthat we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is \nno solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we \nreceive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson \nthat the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income \nupon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the \nturbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to \nthe second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.\nThus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any \nincome form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at \ngetting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this \noutcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying \nprofitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved \nDASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter \nagreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income \nrecognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized \nin Q2 vs. Q3.\nPlease advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or \nif you have any other questions.\nRegards,\nBen",

Mauro Formaggio\nRick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is\n- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority)\nI have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at last week of August, for 1/2 days. \nI would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.\nAlfredo,\nI'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month\nof August.\nThe aspects I'm considering are:\n- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,\n- the operation of hubs,\n- the balancing penalties,\n- the trading of capacity\n- the general operation of a (big) pipeline\n- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC\n- the operation of a shipper\nPlease let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your\namerican colleagues on any of these items.\n---\nIn the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the access practice).\nA visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.\nI think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right. \nIn the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.\nGoing to Omaha would not be a problem for me.\nAs for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).\nThank you and best regards\nMauro\nDear Alfredo,\nI'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte\non TPA practice, there.\nAmong of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit\nat a major pipeline.\nNorthern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible\nexample for me?\nI would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and\nbalancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major\naspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting\npipelines) for transmission and storage.\nI'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent\nof the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.\nThank you and best regards\nMauro",

The DGCCRF (lottery regulators)\nhave confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as\ninvolving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet\ncommunication.  This means that the game probably does fall foul of French\nlottery legislation.   One way round this might be to offer to reimburse\nconnection costs.  If this is done, then there are still a couple of\n\"indirect contribution\" issues to sort out (these relate to being seen not\nto promote Enron, and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions, although\nFrench law on these matters is generally stricter).  There is also a\npossibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed  to adjudicate in the case\nof disupute, but I get the impression from the French advice that this could\nprobably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF.\nIs offering to reimburse connection costs feasible? - if it isn't then,\nthere is presumably little point in \"tidying up\" the indirect contribution\"\nand \"bailiff\" issues.\nThe game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded i.e. there must be an\nexpectation of profit/gain. Hence in theory,  not awarding the prize to a\nFrench resident should allow the game to be played in France.  The French\nlawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically - I\nam not sure I understand their concerns, and have asked them for\nclarification.  I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies,\nand that we would need to exclude employees of such companies, together with\nemployees of other Enron Customers (for example UK companies) who happen to\nreside in France. I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification\nthat such exclusions would suffice, and will forward you the essence of\ntheir replies.\nI set out  below a list of countries where the game would be lawful,\nproviding prizes are not awarded to residents of that country.\nNetherlands\nBelgium\nSweden\n[France] - subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns\nItaly\nAs mentioned in my previous e-mail, some of these countries may move into\nthe \"approved\" list anyway.  I have not received express advice on this\nparticular issue from Norway - but there advice implies that not awarding\nprizes would be ok, and if the tax issue scan be sorted out, Norway may move\nto the approved list anyway.  I will however ask them to confirm the \"not\nawarding prizes\" point for completeness.  I have not received advice on this\npoint from Spain.\nYou may recall that for the Euro 2000 game, colleagues in Belgium were\nconcerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents, then\nthis needs to be made very clear from an early stage, so that Enron are not\nmisleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be\nawarded a prize if they are not going to be.  If ineligbility for prizes is\nplaced prominently in the rules, and partcipants have to read the rules\nbefore playing, then I  guess that this covers this issue.  Although none of\nthe advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point, I think it\nwould apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes.\nCountries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing\nout that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an\nonline registration process are:\nSpain (based on previous Euro 2000 advice)\nItaly\nNetherlands\nDenmark\nSweden\nBelgium - but note the comments made re Euro 2000 that there is a very\nslight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential\ndifficulties i.e. Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium\nparticipants had been properly advised of their ineligibility.  Belgium law\nrequires written proof of such terms in contracts with consumers.\nRules\nI have not had chance to review the rules in detail.  One issue that may be\nimportant from a European point of view is data protection i.e. protection\nof personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to\ntrnsfer data - I will look into this and let you know.  As mentioned above,\nthe inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need\nto be included in the \"eligibility\" section.\nMiscellaneous\nOne issue which was touched upon in a previous e-mail was whether the word\n\"Olympic\" could be used in a disclaimer.  I will look into this further and\nget back to you on this matter next week.  As requested, I will summarize\nthe Olympic advice for you also.\nRegards\nRachel\n____________________________________________________________\nThis message is confidential.

They are quite useful for helping me clarify my own\nthinking.  The following are my responses to your comments and\nclarifications.  The **ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you.\n1.  The money is being set aside to avoid negative values.  It is not clear\nif you mean the values of the cash flow or the PV at the node.  Anyhow, we\nshall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes\nat that cross-section of time as the risk-free asset pays in all states of\nnature.  This will have to be done every time there is a negative\nrealization.  Thus, for the typical project we have, the value of risk\ncapital may be extremely high, as we are not following a tail-based norm\nanymore.\n** I agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement.  I do this\nbecause I have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows, (this\nis discussed in my first memo).  This clearly provides a conservative\nestimate of firm value, and a measure of risk capital that is too high.\nFrom the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital,\nit is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the PV at each\nnode is positive.  Also, one might want to set the level so that the PV is\npositive in say 98% of all nodes.\n2.  Your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all\nvalues being positive.  If so, we are only issuing risk-free debt.  Also, a\nproject with a single negative value at each cross-section of time will not\nhave a positive debt capacity.\n**Again, this is a very conservative initial estimate.  When the model is\nrefined, you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project\ndefaults a certain percent of the time.\n3.  It seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate, which is\nobtained in each step from the comparison investment (by equating the\nvariances).  It is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such\nan effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence.\n**I am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect\non volatility.  In fact, I think the process requires only one iteration\nwhen the volatility is independent of the discount rate.  Again, the idea\nis that we calculate the volatility of the project's value calculated with\nan initial discount rate.  Using the calculated volatility and the stock of\na comparison firm, calculate a more appropriate discount rate.  If the\nvolatility of the project's value is not affected by the change in discount\nrates then we are done.  If, however, the change in discount rates changes\nvolatility, then we may have to iterate.\nLet me know if this makes sense.**\nAlso, our project has a finite life and the market-based assets will have\ninfinite lives.  In the light of this fact, how will we define the relevant\nvariance?  Is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison\ninvestment?\n**This is a good point.  I was thinking in terms of the average variance,\nbut this may not be correct.  Actually, we know that this is just an\napproximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good\napproximation.  Typically, firms tend to ignore issues relating to the\nduration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate,\nwhich clearly does not make sense.  This requires some additional thought.**\n4.  Finally, our criterion is to subtract from the average PV the\ninvestment and also the risk capital.  Setting risk capital to zero, this\nmodel closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and\nendogenously determines the discount rate.\n**This is correct.  My goal was to come up with something that was closely\nrelated to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into\nhow to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate.  There are a\nnumber of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure.  What we need\nto first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the\nkind of projects that you are evaluating.**\nGas Field Case\nTo facilitate your thinking, we are providing a gas field example below.\nWe invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field.  A profile of\nexpected production and variance of the production per year is available\nfrom the engineers at the beginning.  Production will be autocorrelated, as\nthe profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being\nmore or less than the estimated reserves.   We assume the life of the field\nto be 10 years with no salvage value.  There are fixed and variable\noperating costs.  It might be useful for you to think about applying the\nframework to this problem.\n**This problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely\nthat the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing.\nHence, there is no need to be concerned about risk capital (other than the\nx million dollars to buy and develop the property).  To value the property\nassuming all-equity financing we calculate the value process of the\ndeveloped project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment\nwhose value process is observable (e.g., a traded MLP).  The risk-adjusted\nreturn of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash\nflows of the gas field.\nPlease note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and\ncalculating the risk-adjusted return on the comparison investment is not\nnecessarily straightforward. **\nLet me know when you would like to discuss this.\n********************************\nOn another topic, is it possible for you to give me information about one\ncase where Enron bought or sold a base load power plant, where the\npurchaser financed the transaction with non-recourse debt.  We would like\nthe following information:\n1. The value of the power plant (or purchase price)\n2. The amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract.\n3.  Some information about the pricing of gas-power swaps and options.\nAbout a year ago I gave Vince a paper which develops a pricing model for\nproject debt.  I don't think he thought that it could be implemented on the\ntype of projects that Enron finances.  However, my coauthors would like to\ntry applying the model for one case study.\nLet me know when you want to discuss these issues.\nThanks,\nSheridan\nSheridan Titman\nDepartment of Finance\nCollege of Business Administration\nUniversity of Texas\nAustin, Texas 78712-1179\n512-232-2787 (phone)\n512-471-5073 (fax)\ntitman@mail.utexas.edu",

They are quite useful for helping me clarify my own\nthinking.  The following are my responses to your comments and\nclarifications.  The **ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you.\n1.  The money is being set aside to avoid negative values.  It is not clear\nif you mean the values of the cash flow or the PV at the node.  Anyhow, we\nshall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes\nat that cross-section of time as the risk-free asset pays in all states of\nnature.  This will have to be done every time there is a negative\nrealization.  Thus, for the typical project we have, the value of risk\ncapital may be extremely high, as we are not following a tail-based norm\nanymore.\n** I agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement.  I do this\nbecause I have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows, (this\nis discussed in my first memo).  This clearly provides a conservative\nestimate of firm value, and a measure of risk capital that is too high.\nFrom the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital,\nit is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the PV at each\nnode is positive.  Also, one might want to set the level so that the PV is\npositive in say 98% of all nodes.\n2.  Your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all\nvalues being positive.  If so, we are only issuing risk-free debt.  Also, a\nproject with a single negative value at each cross-section of time will not\nhave a positive debt capacity.\n**Again, this is a very conservative initial estimate.  When the model is\nrefined, you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project\ndefaults a certain percent of the time.\n3.  It seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate, which is\nobtained in each step from the comparison investment (by equating the\nvariances).  It is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such\nan effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence.\n**I am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect\non volatility.  In fact, I think the process requires only one iteration\nwhen the volatility is independent of the discount rate.  Again, the idea\nis that we calculate the volatility of the project's value calculated with\nan initial discount rate.  Using the calculated volatility and the stock of\na comparison firm, calculate a more appropriate discount rate.  If the\nvolatility of the project's value is not affected by the change in discount\nrates then we are done.  If, however, the change in discount rates changes\nvolatility, then we may have to iterate.\nLet me know if this makes sense.**\nAlso, our project has a finite life and the market-based assets will have\ninfinite lives.  In the light of this fact, how will we define the relevant\nvariance?  Is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison\ninvestment?\n**This is a good point.  I was thinking in terms of the average variance,\nbut this may not be correct.  Actually, we know that this is just an\napproximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good\napproximation.  Typically, firms tend to ignore issues relating to the\nduration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate,\nwhich clearly does not make sense.  This requires some additional thought.**\n4.  Finally, our criterion is to subtract from the average PV the\ninvestment and also the risk capital.  Setting risk capital to zero, this\nmodel closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and\nendogenously determines the discount rate.\n**This is correct.  My goal was to come up with something that was closely\nrelated to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into\nhow to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate.  There are a\nnumber of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure.  What we need\nto first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the\nkind of projects that you are evaluating.**\nGas Field Case\nTo facilitate your thinking, we are providing a gas field example below.\nWe invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field.  A profile of\nexpected production and variance of the production per year is available\nfrom the engineers at the beginning.  Production will be autocorrelated, as\nthe profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being\nmore or less than the estimated reserves.   We assume the life of the field\nto be 10 years with no salvage value.  There are fixed and variable\noperating costs.  It might be useful for you to think about applying the\nframework to this problem.\n**This problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely\nthat the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing.\nHence, there is no need to be concerned about risk capital (other than the\nx million dollars to buy and develop the property).  To value the property\nassuming all-equity financing we calculate the value process of the\ndeveloped project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment\nwhose value process is observable (e.g., a traded MLP).  The risk-adjusted\nreturn of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash\nflows of the gas field.\nPlease note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and\ncalculating the risk-adjusted return on the comparison investment is not\nnecessarily straightforward. **\nLet me know when you would like to discuss this.\n********************************\nOn another topic, is it possible for you to give me information about one\ncase where Enron bought or sold a base load power plant, where the\npurchaser financed the transaction with non-recourse debt.  We would like\nthe following information:\n1. The value of the power plant (or purchase price)\n2. The amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract.\n3.  Some information about the pricing of gas-power swaps and options.\nAbout a year ago I gave Vince a paper which develops a pricing model for\nproject debt.  I don't think he thought that it could be implemented on the\ntype of projects that Enron finances.  However, my coauthors would like to\ntry applying the model for one case study.\nLet me know when you want to discuss these issues.\nThanks,\nSheridan\nSheridan Titman\nDepartment of Finance\nCollege of Business Administration\nUniversity of Texas\nAustin, Texas 78712-1179\n512-232-2787 (phone)\n512-471-5073 (fax)\ntitman@mail.utexas.edu",

I take full responsibility for \napproving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with \nyou and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services \nfor something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to \nunderstand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy \nservices front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be \nbetter spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum \nnecessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to \ncertain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid, \nlet's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why \nnot have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage \nthat known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to \nthe Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific \nstrategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of \nthings we need to consider.\nJoe Hillings@ENRON\n04/19/2000 04:13 AM\nTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES\ncc:  \nSubject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO\nSteve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon \nputting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for \nyour consideration and decision.\nWe have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general \ninstructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at \nthis stage) you need to know the following.\nThe April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) \nspent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in \nthe WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the \nissue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to \nthat session.\nAs planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is \ncompleting its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable \ninterest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the \ndays ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. \nTonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading \nJapanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He \nraised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too \nfast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in \nSeattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later \nby his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more \ntonight.\nLater today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss \nhow they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical \nadvisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. \nDOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting \nheld at their request.\nNext week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update \nmembers (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is \nessentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official \nhandling energy services.\nShe has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting \nand a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in \nGeneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in \nthe discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of \nassistance. This is a decision point for you.\nWe have made some other committments which are also decision points although \nthe Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings \nthat when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you \nand Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go \nforward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone \nfrom Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the \ncommercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This \nyear they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them \nto exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee \nwill do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.\nFollowing that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the \nESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is \norganizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue \non energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who \nrecently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite \nsupportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to \nCommissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter \nStyles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with \nthe ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not \ntalking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta \nthat we are unable to do the meeting.\nThe last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on \nJune 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC \n(Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world \nconference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American \nand former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD \nCommissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had \nplanned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. \nI introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become \nincreasingly involved in issues of interest to us.\nWell, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to \nproceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is \nlikely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been \naccomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services \nagenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause \ncriticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I \nthought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, \nif you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I \nthink the other meetings are firm committements at this point.\nThese are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.\nJoe",

That one step is over the \nhurdle of how we calculate termination payments.  Please, as you have so \nhelpfully done in the past,  edit the following conversation between Mr. Know \nit All and Mr. Struggler.\nKnow It All:  I don't have a lot of time so get to the point.\nStruggler:  Why can't we supplement  the expression \"present value of the \neconomic benefit\" when we define the word \"Gains\" with the expression:  \n\"using the Discount Rate\" and defining the term so everybody understands how \nwe calculate the present value of the  gains?\nKnow it All:   I've gone over this a number of times with you before, but \nhere we go again:  there are a number of ways to calculate gains and losses.  \nwhen we calculate our gains or losses, we are really just going One method is \nto go out to the market and asking a third party how much they would charge \nus (or pay us) to step into the tragically truncated transaction.   Because \nit is relatively fair, straightforward and easy enough to document, this \nwould probably be our first approach in a default situation.\nStruggler:  So, why don't we just say:  \"the value of the foregone economic \nbenefit?\"  Why do we even have to say anything about the stupid present value \nof it?\nKnow it All:  Ahem, because, we want to maintain as much flexibility as \npossible and another method would be to calculate the total string of \npayments we might have expected to recieve from the defaulting party reduced \nby the payments we would have had to make.  Since we will receive the \ntermination payment up front, it isn't fair to get the full amount of that \ntotal but rather only the \"present value.\"  In addition, using the \nreplacement transaction (market quote) method the present value is the \nalready built into the curve price that's quoted you numbskull!  Another \nmethod would be to unwind our hedge on the other side of the terminated \ntransaction - presumably the amount the counterparty to the hedge would \ncharge (or pay) to unwind that transaction will be very close to the amount \ncalculated by the market quotation (replacement transaction) method.  This \nlast method is quite handy when the terminated transaction was entered into \nto offset a particular trade or when the market has dried up and there are no \nquotes to be had.\nStruggler:  Okay,  my understanding of present value is that you imagine a \nguy who is going to get $100 at a future date, let us say, one year from \nnow.  Do you follow me so far?\nKnow it All:  Please.\nStruggler:  Now, instead of the guy getting the $100 one year from now, he \ngets it today.  But, the $100 today is worth a lot more  than it will be one \nyear from now because the guy is also getting a year of time and time is \nmoney and he can invest the money at a known return rate and so if you gave \nhim the full $100 today he would invest it and one year from now have  $170 \ninstead of $100 and that wouldn't be fair so you are supposed to give him \ntoday just the minimal amount you can get away with so he can invest it and \ncome out with $100 one year from now.  And so, to figure out how much less \nthan $100 to give the guy today, you \"DISCOUNT\" the $100 by some damn rate \nthat everybody seems to know about.   Do you understand?\nKnow it All:   You've pretty well botched it up at a sixth grade level, but \nthat's the idea.\nStruggler:  So, now, if we are calculating the \"present value of the economic \ngain\" of a terminated transaction aren't we basically saying that we would \nhave received $100 in the future for the power , however we now should get \n$30 because we have discounted it with the sacred rate and so why can't we \nsay that the present value is derived from the \"Discount Rate?\"\nKnow it All:  Your lack of real world experience is painful to behold.  Pleae \nmake sure you call somebody if you are ever asked to calculate one of these \nthings.  The Curves price that is quoted to us by the presumably creditworthy \nreplacement counterparty or the counterparty to a hedge that is being unwound \nalready takes into account the present valuing principle.  And of course, if \nyou end up having to discount a stream of payments, there are big problems.  \nFirst, how will you figure out what those payments might have been?  This \nisn't a loan where principle and interest payments can be caluclated in \nadvance with certainty - the payments will fluctuate witht the floating price \nin a swap or the cost of replacement power in a physical deal.  And even if \nwe can figure that out how can we agree on the appropriate discount rate?  An \nin-the-money non-defaulting party wants it to be as low as possible since \nthat will maximize the termination payment received.  But if the \nnon-defaulting party is out-of-the-money then he will want the discount rate \nas high as possible to minimize the payment he has to make.  And just to \ncomplicate things a bit further, these contracts are usually bilateral so we \nhave to be willing to eat what we serve.  So our contract language just says \nthe whole thing has to be \"commercially reasonable.\"  In our view that's \nenough to protect us from a rapacious counterparty if we default and flexible \nenough to let us come to a reasonable result when we are the non-defaulting \nparty.\nStruggler:  I thought the curve was just a list of prices.  You go out to \nOctober 2000 and you see $34.  Isn't that number the price we expect to pay \nfor power or get paid for it on that future date and shouldn't we discount \nthat number if we are getting the money one year early?\nKnow it All:  No!  That $34 is the present value amount we would be willing \nto pay today of what we think for power that will be delivered one year from \nnow.\nStruggler:  You mean we thing one year from now that power will actually be \n$100 and that discounted, it comes back to $34 on our curve at this very \nmoment?\nKnow it All:  You've got it buddy.  Do you think you can handle that \nconcept?  Or do I have to go over it again?  \nStruggler:  Hmmm.  Well I guess so, but why don't we just say  \"the value of \nthe economic benefit based on the Non-Defaulting Party's curve\"?\nKnow it All:  Because then somebody would want to define the word \"curve\" and \nat that point you are getting too close to our holy of holies and we won't \never define our curve.\nStruggler.  Hmmm.  Okay.  Thanks.  ",

The\ndirector then will moderate a panel of three to four executives: Greg; John\nLeggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP; Greg Vesey, head of e-business at\nTexaco; and/or Brad Kitterman, VP North America, Schlumberger Resource\nManagement Services.   Each executive would have 10-15 minutes to discuss\nhis business model and the key issues that the industry must consider during\nthe next year, followed by Q&A to the entire panel.\nLet me know if Greg has a preference to one of these two scenarios and we'll\ntry to accommodate it.\nAbout the audience:\nThe audience is consistently made up of a confluence of energy and\ntechnology executives.  About 30% will be comprised of energy professionals\ninterested in wholesale and retail trading.  For example, we already have\nsome 70 European gas and electricity executives scheduled to attend.\nCisco's London Office is arranging a Pan American tour for these executives\nwith a stop at Interactive Energy. Many other wholesale and retail merchants\nwill also be in attendance, including some large industrial buyers.  Heads\nof energy procurement from Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall's (an\neight-state buying consortium's) have attended in the past.\nPlease let me know if you have further questions.\nThanks,\nBob\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Liz.M.Taylor@enron.com [mailto:Liz.M.Taylor@enron.com]On Behalf Of\nGreg.Whalley@enron.com\nSent: Tuesday, August 22, 2000 7:06 PM\nTo: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com\nSubject: RE: FW: Interactive Energy Keynote Session\nMr. Nimocks,\nHow long are you wanting Greg to speak?

We've\nconfirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American\nEnergy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the\nchairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John\nLeggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.\nInteractive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious\ne-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the\nkeynote\nlast year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents\nfrom\nHalliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote\nsession.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of\nearly registrations and the strong program, we expect this year's to be\nmuch\nlarger.\nIdeally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and\ndescribe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and\nobjectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior\nenergy management who are integrating technology into their core business\nstrategies.\nInteractive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover\ntechnology development across five sectors:\n1) Upstream\n2) Transportation & Logistics\n3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)\n4) Wholesale\n5) Retail\nPress Coverage:\nThe conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the\ngeneral media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than\ntwenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street\nJournal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,\nBloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National\nPublic\nRadio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As\nresult of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,\nincluding Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business\nJournal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,\nEnergy Commerce and others.\nBenefits:\nEnron Net Works will benefit in four ways:\n?    First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing\nsome 70\nsenior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most\ninterested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as\nFord, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium)\nhave\nattended in previous years.\n?    Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba,\nLuminant,\nIBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron's\nvision.\n?    Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron\nattended\nlast year's event.\n?    Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this\narea\nare in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of\nEnron's innovations and rapid growth.\nI hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of\nworking with you and your staff.  I'll call to follow up.\nYours respectfully,\nBob Nimocks\nPresident\nZeus Development Corporation\n2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250\nHouston, TX 77042\nMain: 713-952-9500\nDirect: 832-200-3706\ne-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com",

While livin=\ng in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that h=\ne was hanging out with say \"Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!\"  Blanchard,=\n being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of =\nthe English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant \"All greek girl=\ns are good in bed.\"  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the f=\nirst GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant y=\nears, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and =\nhis Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advi=\nce (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with=\n the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to=\n start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who al=\nl give it up like it was going out o! f style. =20\n=20\nTim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of yo=\nu who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that i=\ns Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wed=\nding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of =\ntown games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mot=\nher on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedd=\ning, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot s=\npeak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mo=\nm asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half Engli=\nsh and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded \"I do not care.  I will be=\n listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway.\"  I know what some of y=\nou are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only w=\neekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been =\nto a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orlea=\nns have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a don=\ne deal, and we are all happy for the couple.\n=20\nThe real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have=\n it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a w=\nedding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fes=\nt!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would =\nleave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw'=\n Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hittin=\ng, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Pan=\nama Jack hat, his         \"Geaux Dinar-deaux\" T-shirt, his jams, and his bl=\nack socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is s=\ntuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.=\n99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.)\nThe plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.) =\n Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, mayb=\ne play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing fo=\nr an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go \"clubbin'\", as I am sure =\nThe Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Sat=\nurday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, =\ndrink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch a=\nnd bet on College Football all day.\nSaturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not =\ndoing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find=\n out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instea=\nd, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be de=\ntermined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin im=\npression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore=\n, on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us=\n have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart =\nwill not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway bl=\now-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered ch=\neating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know.\nThis weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with w=\nhen you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until the=\nn.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September wil=\nl be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that m=\ny boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if deb=\nauchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for=\n him periodically throughout the weekend.\nFor those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for=\n you.  \"Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do i=\ns return the favor.\"\nFor those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an exc=\nuse. \"Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want oth=\ner people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs.\" =\n For all of you single guys, no excuse.\nPlease respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see y=\na'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.  (Chad, if you want to=\n send an e-mail to only me, hit 'Reply to sender.'  If you hit 'Reply to al=\nl'. it sends the message to all of the RECEPIENTS of the original message. =\n I know that you said Law School was such a stupid idea compared to Busines=\ns School, but I think you could learn from some of our lessons, such as it =\nis better to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than to open your mo=\nuth and remove all doubt.)\n=20\nHope this e-mail finds you doing well.\n=20\nSigned,\nGranola, Blarry, your Daddy, Mushroom head, Captain Nic, King, Smokey, char=\nming drunk, your heighness, the one who never looses his emotions when he d=\nrinks, SG Nerd, Governor, lawyer, or anything else you want to call me.\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com << File: =\n~~DLNK0.URL >>",

T-shirts and \ngoodie bag guaranteed to all pre-registrants.\nRide Start:  Cypress High School\nHighway 290 to Barker Cypress exit, go left after exit, and then turn right \non Highway 529 which takes you to the high school. \nQuestions:  Northwest Cyclery - 713-466-1240. \nSaturday, March 31 - 8:00 AM - 23 or 51 miles (NOTE PERMANENT LOCATION CHANGE)\nThis weekly ride now starts at Zube Park. From Telge and HWY 290, keep going \nnorth on 290 for 12 miles.  At the 11.5 mile mark you will see a Texaco \nStation to your right.  Keep going past the intersection by the Texaco \nstation and turn right at your next opportunity (i.e. Roberts Road).  You \nwill see an \"Oakwood Homes\" pre-fab housing lot on the corner of 290 and \nRoberts Road.  Turn right at Roberts\nRoad, and go about 8/10 of a mile to Zube park (on your right).\nPark in the Northwest corner of the parking lot.\nGROUPS OF 10-15 RIDERS ARE SENT OUT BASED ON RIDE SPEED, STARTING WITH THE \nFASTER RIDERS AND WORKING DOWN TO THE MORE LIESURLY PACED RIDERS.  THERE ARE \nSEVERAL ROUTES TO CHOSE FROM, 33, 48, 62 . . . ITS YOUR CHOICE. IF YOU ARE \nNEW TO OUR RIDE, PLEASE PICK UP A MAP. MAPS ARE PROVIDED AT EVERY RIDE.\nTHE NEW RIDER GROUP IS GEARED FOR NEW RIDERS. THE RIDE COORDINATOR WILL TAKE \nTHE GROUP OUT ON A ROUTE DETERMINED AT THE START OF THE RIDE. NO RIDER GETS \nLEFT BEHIND IN THIS GROUP. THIS IS A GREAT GROUP TO RIDE WITH IF YOU ARE NEW \nTO CYCLING.  Questions:  Northwest Cyclery at 713-466-1240\nSaturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly)\nHere is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12, \nand there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick \nScales at Enron - 713-345-3673.\nYou read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!\nSorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact\nstarting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000\nvisitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There\nis a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the\nsame challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from\nRound Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around\nthese towns.\nWeekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am\nThis week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the\nopportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to\nclimb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in\nColumbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful\nZimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book\ngives this ride a score of \"9\" for exercise potential so look for some\nhills.\nThe ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam\nHouston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in\nColumbus by 7:15 am.\nDirections to the Start - Beason's Park\nWe have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone\nis using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us\nwould be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park\ndoes have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.\nBeason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to\ntake I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the\nleft hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.\nFor those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way\nis to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at\nexit 698.\nIf you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on\nI-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at\nthis exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn\nright (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the\nbridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.\nNOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the\nlocal stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your\ndrinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the\nlocal business will look forward to our return.\nHere's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a\nshort memory:\nStarting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!\nThere were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.\nIf you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and\nsigning in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to\nget to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to\nWarrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.\nCheck-in Process\nEvery rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the\nride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are\non the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive\nearly enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.\nIf you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on\nthe alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6\nsheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your\nname.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need\nto complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.\nIf you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on\nthe alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you\nsigned one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't\nread your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive\nearly enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling\nit out.\nI hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to\nensure that you have a safe and fun ride.\nThanks!\nStephen Moskowitz\nConoco Inc.\n(281) 293-2599\nsteve.e.moskowitz@usa.conoco.com",

I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to \nreceive them at this time, but that they are free to check with us in a \ncouple of months to see whether that has changed.  That way, we aren't making \nit an absolute ban.\nThanks for the information.\nMichelle\nDebi Vanwey\n08/11/2000 09:27 AM\nTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: Contracting Solutions  \nThanks for your feedback.   If we accept resumes from an agency it means \nestablishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming \nfor the recruiter.  We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone \ncalls, and it is more work than it seems from the outside.   They almost need \nto be coached all the time unless they are really good, which is rare.    CS \nis one of the fairly high maintenance agencies.   This is why we are going to \na preferred vendor list.    We have lots of agencies that want to work with \nus, and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates \nquickly, and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the \nrecruiters.   After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasn't going to work with her, \nKathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes.   That would certainly \nmake me not want to work with them.   I can force the issue and ask one of \nthe recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to, however I feel that \nuntil Kathryn cools off a little, this would not be productive.    As for the \napology, I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong, however, I \nthink that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of \nwrongdoing on Enron's part.   I'm fine with letting go of it.   This has been \na good learning experience for me.    There have been a couple of phone calls \nthis week where I was consciously more polite with agency/sales phone calls \nthan I would have been prior to last week.    Jennifer had some fear up \nyesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue, \nwhich is understandable, and we're working through it together.  I want her \nto be able to stay in her power with these people, and we just need to learn \nnew ways to do that.   It's a tough job dealing with agencies day after day - \nreally wears you down.    We're going to write some scripts for talking with \nthem in the future, and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me \nso they all get the same story.    We're also putting some new processes in \nplace so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies.    \nHopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future.   \nThanks for all your help......\nDebi\nMichelle Cash\n08/10/2000 11:13 PM\nTo: Debi Vanwey/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jennifer Cronin/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: Contracting Solutions  \nDebi,\nYour plan sounds good to me.  You all have done a good job of researching \nthis data, and I believe we are in a strong position.\nMy one question is whether it is worth it to tell them we are not accepting \nresumes from them.  What is the harm in accepting them?  Are we obligated to \ninterview the candidate?  Given this situation, it is possible that telling \nthem not to send resumes will fan the flames for no good reason, especially \nsince their \"proven track record\" is only for one placement.  It does not \nappear as if they are flooding us with resumes.  Let me know if my assumption \nis not correct.\nAlso, I am not sure your apology is necessary.  It certainly is \nwell-intentioned, but I wouldn't want it to be construed as some sort of \nadmission of wrongdoing.  So, unless you feel compelled, . . . .\nThanks.\nMichelle\nDebi Vanwey\n08/10/2000 02:03 PM\nTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON\ncc: Jennifer Cronin/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Contracting Solutions\nOur research is complete with John Nguyen and Mark Delaro.    There is only \none John Nguyen that works for Enron, and he is at EBS.   This is not the \nsame John Nguyen that was sent from Contracting Solutions.  I talked with the \nEnron John personally and compared past employment to the CS John.    The \nJohn Nguyen that was sent by CS was sent on 5/4 to Keith Dziadek for an \nopening he had.   We got no response from Keith, which for him is considered \na no.    We have no record of Mark Delaro ever being sent in by CS.    He was \ndirectly recruited by Ergos, presented by them, and hired through them.   \nJennifer talked with Mark  and he states that he has never talked to a \nrecruiting firm named Contracting Solutions.   If CS did indeed present his \nresume to Enron, then they should be able to produce the email with date/time \nstamp.    Neither Jen nor I have asked them for this yet.   I feel Robert and \nI should meet with them tomorrow to bring closure to the situation.   Robert \nhad mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I \nthink we should make good on the promise.\nHere are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.\n1)  I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone.\n2)  Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John \nNguyen, based on above facts.\n3)  Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.  \nThe recruiters have just given me their final preferred vendor list, and CS \nis not on it since no one is interested in working with them.   We should let \nthem know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract \nplacement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.    We \naccept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with \nrecruiting.    We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give \nthem a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well \ndefined.  They should contact me directly at that time.\n4)  We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the \ndifficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them, \nKathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been \nmade, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in \norder to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer's \ndecision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)  inadequate resume flow  2) \npoor working relationship with account manager.\n5)  We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other \ncompany including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after \naddressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.   Nor did \nshe did send Mark Delaro's resume to Ergos.  We have no reason to believe \nthat she has ever acted out of integrity while working for Enron, nor that \nshe will in the future.\n6) Cheryl Charles (Maddison) presented her resume to Robert and Ryan, and \nRyan forwarded to me in the past 2 weeks, and has not claimed association \nwith CS.   We have no recruiter openings at this time, and she has been \ninformed of this by Ryan and myself.\nDebi",

Therefore the product will already be there.   In the mean time, all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks/months in advance.  This software change is scheduled for Friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month (February).\nWe have only 2 logged/taped phone calls to the HelpDesk when Portland office has called the HelpDesk  with regard to this issue. Clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap, but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo.

We only seem to have 2 times that  the procedure has been used to the HelpDesk extent and not failed dramatically.\nChanging the procedure for two days (assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods) when we are all working  to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems.  If we do not introduce this software change on Friday we should review this policy - I obviously have no problem with Tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway.\n \nMichael Etringer\n` \n01/26/2000 04:47 PM\n \nTo:\tLouise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc:\tTim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dale Neuner/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject:\tApproval procedure for Pending Products\nI would like to talk  with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products.  IT IS NOT WORKING!  The current procedure is for us to create the product and call Dale Neuner and let him know its out there.  If Dale is not in the office, or it is before or after normal work hours, the traders need to call the help desk, who in turn calls Amita in the London office who then approves the product.   The Portland office starts trading at 5:00 AM PPT.  In the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning.  This morning the traders had several daily products pending approval.  It took 45 minutes to get those products approved.  On daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour.  As a result, the trader missed most of the trading period.  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY AND NEITHER ARE THE TRADERS.  \nA solution was proposed in December, which I have attached below, to address this issue.  However, it only works in the ideal world.  It would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time.  That is not the reality.  By rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade.\nI would like to propose an alternate solution.  We need a direct method for Tim Belden to have approval rights to approve existing products.  These are not new products, we trade them every day.  There is no reason Tim should not have a level of approval to, at the very least approve existing products.  Especially where the only change is the term.\nPlease call Tim Belden at 503-464-3820 or myself at 503-464-3836.

I will always check for DRAFT products at the end of my day and Activate any that are in DRAFT. Just  FYI, Gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days (or weeks) in advance. I keep track of those and keep their products current in advance. It works very well.\n2) I am usually at my desk no later than 7:30 a.m. each day. If trading creates a DRAFT product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the Call Center at 3-4357 and state the following:\nTHIS IS PORTLAND POWER TRADING AND I NEED A PRODUCT ACTIVATED ASAP. PLEASE CONTACT AMITA GOSALIA IN LONDON.\nThe Call Center will then contact Amita, who has the authority and responsibility for activating products.

Countries that can be added to the approved list:\nWe have now received the advice from Portugal, and as with the Euro 2000\ngame, the High Five Flag Game does not violate Portugese law, because\nparticipants do not have to pay to enter and because it is run outside\nPortugal - so you can add Portugal to the list of approved jurisdictions.\nFinland can now also be added to the approved list. The game would not be\nconsidered a lottery, as the players would not pay to enter.  It should not\nbe considered a restricted marketing measure providing there is no\nobligation to purchase goods (which I understand is the situation).  Tax\nissues were also initially a concern i.e. it was thought that Enron might be\nliable to pay tax if it awarded a prize to a Finnish citizen.  However,\nafter discussions with the relevant tax authorities, this tax issue seems to\nhave fallen away - because Enron, as a foreign organiser would not have any\nliabilites towards the Finnish tax office.  [If a Finnish citizen won the\nprize, they themselves might have to pay tax on it - but I assume that this\nis not a concern of Enron, since they themselves would not have liability\ntowards the Finnish tax office].\n2.  Countries that could possibly be added to the approved list, provided\ncertain facts are confirmed (with either Enron or the regulatory\nauthorites),and/or  further information is provided.\nAs with Euro 2000 Poland is also looking likely - the Polish lawyers require\nme to confirm that Enron's customers are permitted to use Enron's website\nfor online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in\nthe past and do not intend to do so in the future.  It is my understanding,\nthat this is the case  - so assuming this is correct, Poland could be added\nto the approved list.\nBelgium - it is unclear under Belgium law whether the game is a Games of\nChance, a Lottery, or a Contest.  They need to forward a demo to the\nregulatory authorities.  I have not yet checked whether the demo sent\nyesterday is complete enough (our web access was very slow thsi morning)  -\nbut, as suggested in your e-mail, I will contact Dave Samuels if I need a\nsubstantially more complete demo.\nItaly - Approval is needed in Italy if the game is an advertising contest\naddressed to Italian residents. The scheme would be classified as an\nadvertising contest - the key is whether it is addressed to Italian\nresidents.  Our Italian lawyers would like to know how many users there will\nbe in Italy, and would like us to confirm that the site will be in English\nand from a server located in the UK. In order to obtain approval, the\nItalian lawyers need to know whether Enron has a subsidiary in Italy - if it\ndoes, the application needs to be made on behalf of this company, - if it\ndoesn't have an Italian subsidiary then they cannot actually apply for\napproval of the scheme.  An integral feature of being an advertising contest\nis that a prize is awarded, so if Italian participants are excluded from\nbeing awarded a prize, the game won't be an advertising contest addressed to\nItalian residents.\nSweden - The game is a lottery under Swedish law and therefore requires\napproval (which there is virtually no chance of Enron obtaining because it\nis not a charitable organisation) if it is addressed to the Swedish public\n(as a general rule more than 250 people).  Our Swedish lawyers therefore\nneed to know how many participants there are in Sweden - if it is less than\n250, then there seems to be a good chance that the game can go ahead - but I\nwill confirm this with them.\nNorway.  There are four issues affecting the game in Norway - these are\nwhether the game is a lottery, whether the game is a money game, whether the\ngame promotes a business, and tax issues.  After informal talks with the\nrelevant ministries, th first two issues have fallen away, and are now no\nlonger a problem.  The Norwegian lawyers had some concerns as to whether the\npurpose of the scheme  was to promote Enron - but I believe that, if I can\nconfirm to them that customers are permitted to use Enron's website for\nonline trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the\npast and do not intend to so in the future -  i.e. that the game is a\n\"gimmick\" and not a promotional tool (as for Poland) this will drop away.\nThe tax issues are similar to those initially expressed by the Finnish\nlawyers - and may fall away after consultation with the Norwegian\nauthorites.\n3.  Jurisdictions where there is a technical  risk of violating local laws\nbut a low risk of enforcement\nNetherlands - technically the game violates the Dutch Games of Chance Act\n(DGCA). However, it  is not clear that the DGCA applies to internet games,\nand our Dutch colleagues are not aware of any instances where internet games\nhave been prosecuted under the Act. They beleive that even if the Dutch\nauthorites were alerted to the game, games offered for a limited period of\ntime for moderate prozes would not be high on teh list of the dutch\nauthorities priorites!  There is also the issue that Dutch courts probably\nwon't consider themselves to have jurisdiction because, for example, the\nprizes are expressed in GBP, the game is run from a UK server, the language\nis English, and the game does not violate laws in jurisdiction it is run\nfrom, although no guarantee of this can obviously be given.\n4.  Miscellaneous\nWe await advice from Spain.  I have received, but not yet reviewed, the\nadvice from France (but from a brief glance, it does not look favouarble\nregarding allowing French citizens to participate).\nI also have advice from the various jurisdictions relating to whether Enron\nemployees themselves can participate (this looks favourable - obviously as\nlong as the game is conducted fairly).  I will review the specifics of this\nadvice, and forward it to you, along with the advice we have on disclaimers.\nI should be able to do this this afternoon/evening  (UK time).\nI have advice from most of the jursidictions on Olympic legislation.  Would\nyou like a summary of this advice for future reference? - it makes\ninteresting, if largely depressing, reading!\nRachel\n____________________________________________________________\nThis message is confidential.

His \nconcerns regarding swaptions and asian options are accurate.  IT is currently \nworking on new volatility curves for swaptions to use.  IT is also working on \ncorrelations in order for asian options to be valued properly.  London trades \nmany more swaptions and asian options than the US; therefore, the impact of \nnot having swaption volatility curves and correlations is greater to them.  \nThe majority of options in the U.S. are European monthly and daily exercises \nand the current volatility curves adequately take care of these deals.  The \nidea of swaption volatility curves has floated around in the US, but other \nmore material items always got in the way and we continue to use the deal \nspecific volatilities for the swaptions we do have.  Once the technology is \nin place to use swaption volatilities we will also adopt.   The system was \noriginally built to handle the physical power world that existed in the US \nand as new markets and new ideas (such as the US becoming more and more of a \nfinancial market) we will need to enhance Enpower to follow suit.  Swaption \nvols and asian options are two of these enhancements. \nAlso, it is difficult to get option data out of Enpower.  We have in stage an \noption sensitivity matrix that, once implemented into production. I will be \nsure that James knows about.  It probably will not solve all his problems, \nbut it will give him a starting place.\nStacey\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           12/11/2000 11:00 AM\n\t\nTo: Stacey W White/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Enpower\nIn cleaning up e:mails, I ran across this one that I had not yet read.

We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a \nmatrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you \nmay be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the \ndeal ticket and not off any volatility curve. \nThe current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue \nfor us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at \nthe deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot \nuse the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise \noptions and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any \nway in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the \nfew we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' \npiece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of \nworrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the \ncorrect underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) \nthe last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  \nunderlying. \nThey are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel \nwho have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most \nexperienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). \nThis is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of \nEnron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the \nvolatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that \ndifferent volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value \nthe swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns \nover the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it \ndoes not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc \ncalculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike \nprice to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the \nforward price of the underlying itself. \nWe have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in \nPower 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start \nto value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.\nOnce we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or \ngamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no \nthere (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure \ngiven all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what \nthe risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have \nPower option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega \nor gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to \nwork on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like \nto know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem \n(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the \nimplementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current \nsystem it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we \nvalidate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?\nDespite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher \nvolatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their \nVAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily \nremark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol \ncurve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any \ntesting etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). \nThe swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the \nimpacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.\nI would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing \nthe boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been \ncovered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having \nto use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and \nare having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies \nof Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have \nnot been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in \ngaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that \nit is not for a lack of trying.\nSorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived \ninaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.\nJames",

I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He\nimmediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, \"Why\"!  He then\njumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's\n6 yrs. old.  I said, \"Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just\ngo on & get out of here.\"  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't ask\nwhere he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really\ndon't have time for his mess.\nSo, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?

It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could\nhave taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I\nhad a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they\nhad their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was\nnice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at\n6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at\n6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms\nThang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my\nsemi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite\nstores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor\nlength (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that\nI bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore\nmy rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I\nwear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel\nsandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When\nI came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said\n\"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the\nhusband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some\npictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).\nWe have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd\nsaid the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really\nentails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!\nLooking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was\nwondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's\nback in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.\nHow did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get\na chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home\nuntil around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power\nMart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.\nRight now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All\nwe do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,\nindependent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and\nnew environment.\nOh well, talk with you later!\nThanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!\n    -----Original Message-----\n   From:   Nytasha.Sims@dynegy.com@ENRON\n[mailto:IMCEANOTES-Nytasha+2ESims+40dynegy+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com]\n   Sent:   Friday, October 05, 2001 10:12 AM\n   To:     Mims, Patrice L.\n   Subject:  Hello\n   Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been\n   extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report\n   card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into\n   sickness.\n   I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she\n   still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The\n   4th\n   grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in\n   prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's\n   dumb\n   and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter\n   last\n   night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's\n   not.\n   She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me\n   so\n   bad.\n   Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The\n   best\n   thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.\n   How's the school search going for Jordan?\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\nthe intended recipient (s).

Anyway, I had already started a reply \nto your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....\nI love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say \nanything of worth about this whole incidence.

It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the \nimportance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. \nBut I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of \ntears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and \nMolly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I \ntook a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched \nthe Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening \nWITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for \nthat.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the \nother line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a \nmessage, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's \ngirlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was \nvery confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with \"us.\" I just \nassumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse \nabout how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no \nway is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. \nNO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man \nhimself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date \nand then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in \nthis enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride \nand didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a \nlame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be \nsmart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told \nhim that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and \nmy roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the \nother night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that \nhe might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is \nwhere he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to \ncome over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who \nwe somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't \nremember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're \nhome in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things \nAmber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap \nstories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, \nactually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if \nyou see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red \nLaundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have \nto go. I'll call you tonight!\nTake care, \nkate\nAnna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/23/2001 08:06:18 AM\nTo: \"'Kate.Symes@enron.com'\" <Kate.Symes@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE:\nThat sucks, Kate.  I bet that isn't the last we'll be seeing of Mr. Running\nMan, though.  First of all, who gets scared off by drunk roommates?  If\nanything it should be a relief to him that he doesn't need to impress any of\nyour clan.  Second, it sounds like the classic insecure blow-off to me.  If\nyou think back, you'll probably remember a couple of instances in which your\ndemeanor/comments/facial expression may have sent him the message that he is\nthe stupidest thing on God's green earth.  I know this because I have the\nsame habit.  So he probably went home, mulled over those few devastating\ninstances, and came to the conclusion that you're not that into it.  And\nbeing a man (only men and Symes's do this), he cancelled on you before you\nhad the chance to crush his ego once again.  Am I right?  I think so.\nTentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night.\nI'm mad that I'm hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out\nwith you!  Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket, since we know\nyou'll never save the money (like I should talk).  You have to come out\nhere, though.

You would\nlove it, too.\nOkay, feel better, and don't sweat the stupid running guy.  If he thinks\nhe's not worthy of you, chances are he's not.

Molly was on the \nother line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a \nmessage, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's \ngirlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was \nvery confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with \"us.\" I just \nassumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse \nabout how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no \nway is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. \nNO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man \nhimself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date \nand then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in \nthis enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride \nand didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a \nlame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be \nsmart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told \nhim that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and \nmy roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the \nother night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that \nhe might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is \nwhere he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to \ncome over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who \nwe somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't \nremember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're \nhome in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things \nAmber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap \nstories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, \nactually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if \nyou see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red \nLaundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have \nto go. I'll call you tonight!\nTake care, \nkate\nAnna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/23/2001 08:06:18 AM\nTo: \"'Kate.Symes@enron.com'\" <Kate.Symes@enron.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: RE:\nThat sucks, Kate.

He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of\n   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick\n   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College\n   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has\n   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.\n   \"The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks\" - What a\n   joke that statement is.\n   \"LSU would whip UT\"  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.\n   \"UT is the most overrated team in college football\" - interesting since\n   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason\n   polls.\n   \"Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban\n   is better\" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he\n   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red\n   Stick - just THIS SEASON.\nEvery college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the\nBig XII.\nThe BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!\nTwo of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top\nranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.\nThe only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play\nagainst each other.\nThe highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic\nArkansas.\nAll football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.\nPeyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss\nthat just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick\non national television on a cool October Saturday night.\nCajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play\ncollege ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.\nI can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.\nNFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State\nfootball player.\nDavid Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes\non and on.  It is really pathetic.\nTexas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony\nBrackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake\nBrockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in\nhis first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.\nTexas players are magic baby.\nNot to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and\nTommy Nobis\nI hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend\nLousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.\nAt least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like\noffense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God\nwilling with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of\nOU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.\nI guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems\npretty foolish to you now doesn't it.\nThat dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might\nhave a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between\nhow Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night\nshowed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling\nis the best way to describe his play.\nCKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store\nbecause you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me\nthe night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You\nboldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since\nall you were ranting was \"tiger bait, tiger bait\" any time I was trying to\ntell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have\nalready done this season.\nThe bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher\nat the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas\nYou =  LSU.\nWell since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not\nfinish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even\nfinish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash\n- or we can work out an installment plan.\nLenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the\nname but know the face).\nIt looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of\nTexas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor\nto the east - Lousyanna.\nTexas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3\ntime champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.\nConversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,\nand the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.\nThe last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader\nof the free world.\nThe last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for\nthe next 15 years or so.\nAnd the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are\nno jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna\nEven the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only\nprofessional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell\nand Ricky Williams.\nHe who laughs last laughs best.\nMan this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.\nHook 'Em\nVal forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken\nland east of the Sabine.\nThe Truth shall set your people free.\nBrian\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged or confidential information.

It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its \nnetwork transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have \nto purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the \nplant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to \nsupply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin \nPresto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's \nnetwork transmission to delivery to third parties.\nIs this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent \nrulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While \nVEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that \nyou do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to \ntransmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only \nway to ensure deliverability to third parties.\n3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an \nincrease.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other \nsources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission \nand subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on \nbest/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase \ndaily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of \nreceipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as \nnon-firm.)\n12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that \nhas not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since \nFERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant \nchanges in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining \ntransmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this \ncontract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price \ncovers that circumstance.\nUnderlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at \nmost any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any \ncurrent transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will \npay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this \ncontract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.\nTom Chapman\n06/13/2000 06:07 PM\nTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: VEPCO PPA\nChristi--\nThis is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively \nearly draft of the PPA.\nI think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and \ndo the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  \nIN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up \nthe regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue \nless contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at \nRockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  \nUsing the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their \ngas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas \nfrom the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the \nNCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think \nthat we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply \nworking on some of the siting issues.\nThat being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or \nJeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there \nare some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  \nThanks.\nTom\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 06:04 \nPM ---------------------------\nLinda J Simmons\n06/13/2000 08:45 AM\nTo: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron, Heather Kroll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ozzie \nPagan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey M Keenan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: VEPCO PPA\n----- Forwarded by Linda J Simmons/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 08:44 AM -----\n\t\"Nancy Wodka\" <nwodka@bracepatt.com>\n\t06/12/2000 04:20 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: <linda.j.simmons@enron.com>, <lisa.mellencamp@enron.com>\n\t\t cc: \"William Frederking\" <wfrederking@bracepatt.com>\n\t\t Subject: VEPCO PPA\nLisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based \non the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did \nencounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are \nnoted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and \nare also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this \ngoes to VEPCO.\nCover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be \nENA or a special purpose company?\nDefinitions--  We included a defined term \"Emergency Start-Up\" (a start up or \nincrease in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to \ninclude a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.\nSection 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy \ncharge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?\nSection 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD \nwill be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, \nit would be best to define \"commencement of construction\" to avoid \ncontroversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a \nplaceholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is \nyour preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific \nremedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that \nmilestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would \nbe a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 \ndays if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the \ncure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?\nSection 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under \nthis PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement \nto sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the \nFacility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take \n1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be \npro-rated for the first year?\nSection 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of \nAvailability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the \ntotal hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated \nthat the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other \nthan due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled \nmaintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be \navailable.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated \nthat a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why \nwouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we \nincluded language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during \npeak periods.\nSection 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of \nEnergy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we \nallow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?\nSection 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.\nSection 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?\nArticle 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not \nhave any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do \nyou want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for \nnow?\nSection 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or \nwould you prefer a shorter period?\nArticle 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step \nprior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is \n\"baseball\" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's \nposition or the other's.  Is that what you want?\nSection 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it \nwill be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not \nrecommend Virginia law for this contract.\nExhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please \nsee the bracketed notes therein.\nPlease call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.\n - VEPPPA.DOC",

I don't know if you'd like to\nstay at the Manta Bay hotel because you may not like scuba-diving with the\nbig manta rays.  Up to you...  She said she send us more info on Yap to be\narriving in the mail shortly, so we can make a decision about that.  I still\nlike Caroline's best for the first week and the wedding ceremony.

By Austin B=\nay   Are Californian's Stupid? This Texan's reply is, \"Nope, not at all.\" C=\nalifornia is home turf for a high-flying slice of America's most economical=\nly and aesthetically creative people. I dig Hollywood, admire the Skunk Wor=\nks and thoroughly respect Silicon Valley.   But apparently California Gov. =\nGray Davis has a low opinion of his constituents' mental acuity, or at leas=\nt their historical memory. He seems to think Golden State residents were ha=\ntched yesterday, producing a demographic ripe for a political con job reple=\nte with fear-inciting sound bites and calculated flim-flam.   In ecology-co=\nnscious California, Davis has hired two acid-spewing generators of politica=\nl pollution and cultural degradation, Clinton hit men Chris Lehane and Mark=\n Fabiani.

Well, if you =\ndo business with the federal government, it's time you took a crash course =\n-- in languages, that is. If you don't, you may be in danger of violating f=\nederal civil rights law.

A black man named Franklin Thompson was elect=\ned to an open seat on the Omaha City Council. What makes this victory so si=\ngnificant is that an overwhelmingly white constituency chose him over an at=\ntractive, wealthy, white business owner who spent four times as much money,=\n only to receive two-thirds as many votes.   How can this be? Those who hav=\ne made a career out of what is loosely called \"civil rights\" tell us consta=\nntly that rampant racism in America would preclude such a thing from happen=\ning. How can a black man be given such a mandate by an almost all-white con=\nstituency?

At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.  The Houston Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.  Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare. The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!  However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.  Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.\nWhen we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.  I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.  One day the contractor almost died in the house... he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!  He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!  Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.  It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron.  All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.  \nTalking about wild flowers and plants.. the same is true for Costa Rica.   Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica.  I recommend that on your places to go list.\nMerry Christmas, Feliz Natal, and Feliz Navidad\nLater\nPaul\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"daarontaylor at hotmail dot com\" <daarontaylor@hotmail.com>@ENRON  \nSent:\tThursday, December 20, 2001 2:47 PM\nTo:\tThomas, Paul D.\nSubject:\tRe: Hello\nCher Paul:\nThat sounds like a nice marriage.  When we got married it was nothing\nextraordinary, just a small and informal marriage celebration.\nYeah, I know Braeswood and Buffalo.  I'm sure you paid a pretty penny for\nthe neighbourhood -- it's a nice area.  We've done horrendous amounts of\nwork to our apartment.  We are doing something like a loft with it and we\nhad to gut it by removing most of the walls and floors, etc.  Soon we will\nbe putting in a mezzanine floor (it's a trendy thing here).  We had two huge\nbins full of debris in front of our home for about a week!  Artisans in\nFrance don't like working very much and when they decide to work they do\njust enough of it to get by so customers are very unsatisfied when they are\nfinished.  Inevitably, the customer must always bargain the price down at\nthe end because more artisans must be hired to come in and finish all that\nwhich was not done.  It's a hell of a mess but to be fair the same problems\nexist in the States it's just that I've never owned a home before.  In the\nend I decided it's much easier and faster to do it yourself and bypass the\ncontractor all together.  Plus you can do a much better job yourself!\nYes, I need to go to Rio.  I've been to Hawaii and to date it is the most\nbeautiful place I have ever seen.  Waikiki has exotic flowers -- that cost\n$15 a piece anywhere else -- growing on the sidewalks like any ordinary\nflower!!!\nBTW, I was thoroughly impressed with Yosemite.

We got married in small church on the\nLagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the\ngiant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family\nand friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!\nWe bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a\nlot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to\nenjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.\nWe are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much\nlonger we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it\noff.\nAs far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine\nwe will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking\nvacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for\nweek and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be\nstuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is\ndifferent from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome,\nLondon, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is\none of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a\ncity settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the\nwhite sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!!\nTake care and have a great Christmas.\nPaul\n    -----Original Message-----\n   From:   \"daarontaylor at hotmail dot com\" <daarontaylor@hotmail.com>\n             @ENRON\n   Sent:   Monday, December 17, 2001 2:36 PM\n   To:     Thomas, Paul D.\n   Subject:  Re: Hello\n   Hi Paul:\n   How have you been?  How is Enron treating you?, well I hope?\n   Yeah, we moved to Lyon at the beginning of 2000.  When looking at a map\n   of\n   our solar system, Lyon is practically in the center of France.  We're\n   more\n   or less located at the foot of the French Alps.  At about a million\n   people,\n   Lyon is smaller than Houston.\n   Because of the Internet Boom, my Internet investments appreciated enough\n   to\n   buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the\n   city.  We've been renovating it ever since.  I've learned a hell of a\n   lot\n   about working on homes!\n   Before David Underwood got fired he told me that you got married and\n   bought\n   a house in or near Linkwood (off Stella Link).  I imagine you married\n   that\n   young Brazilian lady that you were dating while at Genesis?\n   F?licitations!\n   Have you been to Brazil?  I'd like to see it one day if ever the\n   opportunity\n   presents itself.  Since you're hitched now, I guess you are obligated to\n   have children soon. :)\n   So yes, since the 22nd of September I've been the proud father of a baby\n   girl -- Camille.  She's a real angel and quite a character too (read\n   rascal).  I hope Enron allows you to receive e-mail attachments that are\n   not\n   work related because I've attached a photo of her that is as recent as\n   tonight.  She's got brown eyes like her mommy.\n   I heard you went to NYC.  How did you like it?  I love NYC and I was\n   just\n   there one week ago!  No matter how many times I go there I will never\n   run\n   out of things to do.  This last time I saw an exhibit on Brazil at the\n   Guggenheim.  There are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that\n   I've not seen so I know I will return.  Actually, I ponder the idea of\n   getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little\n   American culture for six months at a time (NYC is only six hours from\n   Paris).  Since Camille is American, I think this would be good for her.\n   Of\n   course the problem is the price of an apartment.  It's bloody expensive,\n   mate.  (Stress BLOODY)  I asked one agency and they told me $450,000 for\n   a\n   studio apartment in a nice area on Manhattan (I don't know how accurate\n   this\n   off-the-cuff quote was).  That's a little too much for me unless I get a\n   mortgage which I horror the idea of owing any bank money.  Perhaps\n   something\n   cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood.  You know, the ones with\n   ugly\n   whores hanging around every small street intersection.  Then there's\n   Harlem,\n   maybe I can get a pad next to Clinton's.\n   June 10th, 2000, we got married for a second time.  The marriage was in\n   France and all my in-laws attended as well as my mother and aunt too.\n   They\n   (my mother and aunt) were a little shocked to say the least.  They speak\n   no\n   French and were like fish out of water (to say the least).  But you\n   didn't\n   hear this from me.\n   I've tons of little day-to-day stories that are worth a laugh but this\n   e-mail covers all the big stuff that's been happening.\n   Best Regards,\n   Aaron\n   **********************************************************************\n   This e-mail is the property of Genesis Business Management Systems, Inc.\n   and/or its relevant\n   affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the\n   sole\n   use of the intended\n   recipient (s).

You always assume the worst when really the reasoning was\nkind of flattering - he thinks so highly of you that he doesn't want you to\nsee him upset.  I think that's a valid excuse, I'm totally the same way.\nThe other night I bagged on Nathan's dinner party, which I really wanted to\ngo to, because I was afraid I would start slurring my speech before my first\ncocktail.  You know what that's like, to be working so hard that you don't\nfeel like yourself.  Anyway, I'm glad it all worked out!\nMichelle and I went out with Monica, John, Amber, Marky and John's brother\nMark on Saturday night.  It was so insane.  First of all, I was already\nexhausted and therefore drunk before we even left the first bar, regardless\nof my 8am shift at Starbucks the next morning.  Then when we went to\nNathan's bar, Amber and Marky SKIPPED ahead, knocking the odd garbage can\nover along the way.  So they got to the bar before me, and they found Nathan\nbecause Monica told them he looked just like Chandler Bing, and Amber was\nlike \"Are you Anna's boyfriend?\".  Thanks.  He was really cool about it\nthough, even though I think it caught him off guard.  I had to explain to\nhim that I NEVER used the word boyfriend, but he said he was flattered so it\nwas cool.  We were such an odd group: Amber and Marky were dancing with no\nequilibrium, Monica's boyfriend and brother sat in the corner and remained\nmute, Michelle was telling Monica how she should really meet her bipolar\ncousin.  I was sure after that night that I would never see Nathan again,\nbut yesterday he took me to THE CUTEST little french restaurant, and we had\nwine and two courses and dessert.  It was so great!  And some of his friends\ncame and had a cocktail with us afterwards and he had his arm around me the\nwhole time.  He is SO GREAT!!!!  I don't know how accurate of a description\nI am giving you, but I have never been so happy with a boy before.  He is\nfunny and cute and he loves wine and food.  Anyway, that's my deal.  Oh, and\nDad and Laura are not going to be here until tomorrow, but he called from\nthe Grand Canyon (I'm so jealous) and said my car is a \"beautiful\" champagne\ncolored Corolla.  I'm a little worried, but he said it's like new so I'm\nsure it'll be great.\nI think that on your next payday, you should put a bid on priceline.com for\na ticket here.  We would have so much fun!  Or you could even go through\nmom's travel agent and buy your ticket really far in advance - she said it\nwas only about $200 if you do it that way.  Of course, the later you come,\nthe sunnier it will be.  Anyway, I REALLY want you to visit!  And Monica\ndoes, too.\nOkay, keep me updated on the Dave situation - he sounds like boyfriend\nmaterial.  You should call me soon!

You'll never guess how cool mine is\nthough. It's \"Don't go breakin' my heart\" by Elton John and Kiki Dee!\nRemember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to\nwatch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply\nto your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....\nI love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say\nanything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me\nblankly and said something like, \"Don't be so overly dramatic,\" and then\nrationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to\nhang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend\nand blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand\nthe importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not\nfun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the\nverge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with\nAmber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then\nMolly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it\nhome, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very\nsuccessful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take\none point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30.\nMolly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me\nthere might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill,\nDave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very\ncomplicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer\nwith \"us.\" I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up\nsome sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move,\nbecause I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me\nand expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At\nabout 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's\npsycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya\nthink?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work\nand had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in\nsuch a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd\nreached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something\ninstead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed\nand could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and\nfinish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was\nover) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his\nbalance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now.\n(that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help\nme make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere\nalong the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing\nthat. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June\nbecause it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did\nthe other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories\nwhen you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes,\nactually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so\nif you see anything you want back, just let her know.

To date, SCE has \nreceived signed agreements from QFs representing approximately 95% of its \nrenewable energy capacity and today executed those contracts. The company \nhopes that the small number of remaining producers will also agree. Certain \nelements of the agreements are subject to the approval of the California \nPublic Utilities Commission.\nThe plan calls for generators to provide power at a fixed price -- 5.37 \ncents/kWh -- over the next five years, eliminating some of the price \nvolatility that has plagued California's energy markets during the current \ncrisis. The plan stays all existing legal action, and assures that no new \nlegal action will be initiated unless the terms of the agreement are not met.\n\"The people of Edison are committed to pursuing the benefits of negotiated \npractical solutions to California's energy crisis,\" said Frank. \"The QF \nagreement and the MOU, if approved, are critical steps toward resolving the \ncrisis. A bankruptcy, in contrast, would lead to years of delay and \nuncertainty for our customers and raise serious questions about the business \nclimate in California.\" \nAn Edison International company, Southern California Edison is one of the \nnation's largest electric utilities, serving a population of more than 11 \nmillion via 4.3 million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile service \narea within central, coastal and Southern California. \nSOURCE Southern California Edison \n/CONTACT: Corporate Communications of Southern California Edison, \n626-302-2255/ ",

It is believed\nto be published by French persons with close connections to the French\nsecurity services and also, reportedly, to Israeli intelligence.  The\nwebsite includes free content (of which this report was a part) and premium\ncontent available on a subscription basis only.  The Andre LeGallo posting\ncould reflect the purely detached academic/professional interest of the\npublishing entity.  It is also worth considering that it would be a\nconvenient document for one of your competitors to pass on to a foreign\ngovernment with whom you might be negotiating, particularly if that\ngovernment had elements or constituencies sensitive to the perception of\nlinks to U.S. intelligence.\nPlease let me know if you would like any further information on this matter.\nBest regards\nEdward\n(INTELLIGENCE NEWSLETTER #376 - 17/02/2000)\nUNITED STATES : Enron Loses Intelligence Star\nThe U.S. gas and electricity utility Enron has parted ways with Andre Le\nGallo who was in charge of dealing with the group's most sensitive cases. A\nformer CIA official known for his extreme discretion, Le Gallo quit the\nHouston-based company in January to open his own business intelligence firm,\nAJL Global Risks Solutions.\nHis recent departure was known to only a few North American consultants. In\nhis job as Enron's vice president for security, Le Gallo had worked behind\nthe scenes on all of the difficult cases facing the group that required\nmaximum confidentiality.\nSome believe his career with Enron served to underline the close links that\nreportedly exist between the company and the CIA. The first claims to that\neffect were made in the early 1990s when Kenneth Lay, founder and president\nof Enron appeared as a major financial backer of then-U.S. president George\nBush. It was said Enron won favors from the American intelligence community,\nwith the White House's blessings.\nOne instance supposedly occurred in June, 1992 in India when Enron's local\naffiliate Dabhol Power Company won the right to operate on huge gas\nresources at Maharashtra near Bombay, in highly controversial circumstances.\nAt the time, Indian political leaders suspected the American ambassador in\nNew Delhi, Franck Wisner, of having asked the CIA station chief in the\nIndian capital to ensure Enron won the contract. A few years later, on Dec.\n15, 1997, the same Franck Wisner was named a director of Enron Gas & Oil Co.\nIn a further example of ambiguous links, the State Department is accused of\nalso backing Enron in 1993 in negotiations for a contract to restore oil\nwells on the Shuaiba field in Kuwait that had been damaged during the Gulf\nWar. Enron got the contract even though its bid was less advantageous than a\nlower bid submitted by Germany's Deutsche Babcock. The existence of ties\nbetween the former Bush administration and Enron can be seen in a new light\nin view of the coming presidential campaign in the U.S. According to a\nreport by the Federal Election Commission, Bush's son --George W. Bush --\nhas already used an aircraft owned by the Enron company seven times since he\nbegan his race for the presidency.\nCopyright 2000 Indigo Publications\nReproduction or dissemination prohibited under any form whatsoever\n(photocopy, mailing lists, intranet, etc.) without written permission of the\neditor.\nIndigo Publications - 142 rue Montmartre, 75002 Paris, France\nTel. : +33 1 44 88 26 10 - Fax : +33 1 44 88 26 15\nEmail : webmaster@IntelligenceOnline.com\n<mailto:webmaster@IntelligenceOnline.com>\nEdward Grubb\nhttp://www.crg.com\nphone: +1 (703) 893 0083 ext. 203\nfax: +1 (703) 893 1836\nemail: Edward.Grubb@control-risks.com\nThis e-mail contains priviledged and confidential information intended for\nthe use of the addressees named above.

These procedures will be used as a strawman proposal for standardized interconnection procedures throughout the country.  FERC is going to hold an informal conference in Washington the week after RTO Week (i.e. the week of Oct. 22) to hammer out these issues.  The hope is that consensus will be reached.  Once the procedures are resolved, FERC will then address costs.  Wood wanted to address both issues at the same time since they are so closely related, but Brownell and Breathitt both thought it was better to separate the issues since cost issues are expected to be more contentious and they did not want to slow down getting standardized procedures in place.\nMarket Based Rates:\nThis issue was stricken from the agenda.  Wood said they need more time to study the issue.  Breathitt stated some concern that they are going to use the SMA screen (discussed last meeting) because it is still somewhat undefined.  After discussion, however, all the commissioners agreed that they are not voting on anything, and they will decide whether use of the new screen makes sense when they see a draft order applying the new screen to either a triennial review or a new application for market based rates.  Due to RTO Week, Staff does not expect to get an order out using the new screen until November.  \nMidWest ISO:\nDonna will provide a more complete account of the order, but there were a couple of interesting statements.  This case is primarily about rate issues raised by the MidWest ISO filing.  From the discussion, it sounds like the commission is going to provide some RTO guidance to Midwest, even though the order does not address the scope issue, but it appears that the commissione is still looking at an implementation date of December 15, 2001 for MISO.  We will have to see the order to better understand what this means.\nWood had some interesting questions about costs.  Apparently, MISO proposes to assess a 15 cent administrative fee for its services.  Wood asked why the corresponding savings are not being reflected in the individual utilities' rates.  Because the RTO is now going to provide many of the services the utilities were previously providing, Wood said he would expect the utilities rates to go down, by more than 15 cents collectively, and he wonders where those savings are going to be reflected.  This is good -- Wood is going after the utilities and not allowing them to play these types of games they have played for years now.\nCarolina Power and Light and Florida Power Corp.\nThis is an order on rehearing.  FERC grants rehearing of a prior order regarding imbalance penalties.  Some intervenors argued that the penalties should be credited back to customers.  The prior FERC denied this request and allowed the utility to retain the penalties, but the new FERC has granted rehearing.  Wood said this is consistent with gas and he think basic customer issues should be treated similarly on the gas and electric side.  This too is a good sign that Wood \"gets it\" and sees no reason why the electric industry should not be treated the same as gas.  We have been arguing for this for years.  This is hopefully a sign of more good things to come.\nCall us if you have any questions.",

Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor. \nThere are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month. \nRDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday. He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast. \nSecretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference. On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans. \nNoble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings. The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy. Join us for all the details on Monday. \nENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week. Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move. Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday. \nFormer Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis. Kym will have all the details on this story next week. \nFinally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast. \nKeep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

I used the current production port_calc (3.15) to calculate 1389454 and I used the old version(3.14) to calculate 1389464. I do see a P& L change on 1389454.\nI debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P& L value. Enclosed is a partial list of those deals. The reasons are: \nIn old version(3.14), we calculate volatility of basis options like this\n1) we calculate the NG volatility\n2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF- volatility curve. If IF- volatility curve exists, we use IF-volatility curve.\n3) If IF- volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility.\nIn the current production version(3.15), we calculate volatility of basis options like this\n1) we calculate the NG volatility + NG vol skew. (The NG vol skew is based on NG price - fixed price)\n2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF-volatility curve. If IF-volatility curve exists, we use IF- volatility curve.\n3) If IF-volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility + NG vol skew which was calculated in step 1).\nThe bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step 2), we didn't apply vol skew upon IF vol. In our new fix, this bug will be fixed.\nHowever, the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist. So the current production version (3.15) used the NG vol + NG vol skew for those deals. The old version (3.14) used the NG vol for those deals. Thus you see P&L change in these two versions.\nAlso we'd like to confirm with you that in the new fix, if the IF vol curve does not exist, you still want us to use NG vol + NG vol skew instead of erroring out. If the IF vol curve exists, we will use IF vol + NG vol skew.\nThanks,\nJennifer\nJinwen (Jennifer) Song\n713-853-5248\njennifer.song@enron.com\n << File: basis.xls >> ",

Grant County PUD:  (Washington)   we have orally agreed (no signed \nconfirms) to two identical deals,  each calls for us to deliver power to \nGrant during year one and for Grant to deliver us power and money in year 4 \nor 5.  Our effort to get an opinion from them that these deals have been \nproperly authorized has foundered badly.  We have the classic situation of a \nPUD whose procedural practice does not fit with the statute.  They are \nirritated to have this pointed out to them and so far, unwilling to go back \nand fix their practices for fear of embarassment before the Board.  \nDelicate,  complex, difficult mess.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives helping.   \n2.  Clatskanie: (Oregon)  We have done a deal ( signed confirms and EEI soon \nto be signed) whereby we deliver Clatskanie power in year 1, for which we \nreceive a monthly payment which is roughly akin to a contract price,  and \nthey deliver us power in year 5.   We have every expectation of receiving a \nsatisfactory legal opinion from them when they return the signed EEI \nagreement.\n3. EWEB: (Oregon)   We have done a deal (being documented as a swap by the \nswap group) which I believe is a five year deal.  The deal was originally \nconceived as being a physical transaction.  We  received satisfactory \ndocumentation about authorization from EWEB for the physical transaction, but \nwhen it switched over to being a swap at the last minute,  and Sara \nsubsequently reviewed the authorization issue,  her conclusion was that we \nwere not satisfied with what EWEB had shown us.  I have gotten Pat Boylston  \nto get EWEB to promise to give us a Board resolution in a couple of weeks \naddressing the financial risk concern.  \n4. Valley Coop. (Nevada)  We have recently done a 4 year vanilla commodity \nsale to Valley and are in the process of checking out their authorization to \ndo longer term deals.   We have a services agreement with them whereby we are \ntheir SC for load balancing purposes involving the California market.  A \nquestion has arisen as to whether or not certain sales we make to them as \npart of this arrangement  may generate revenue for them in excess of 15%,  if \nso, perhaps putting their tax exempt status as a muni in jeopardy.  It is a \ntax, accounting issue.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives is helping us sort it out.\n5. LMUD (California)  City of Lassen.  We are trying to do a long term sale \nof power to them.  Attempts to check out authorization have run into a \ncomplex, California municipality statute and a small town lawyer and we are \npresently stalled out.  Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle is helping as best \nhe can.  The commercial deal died its first death yesterday but rigor mortis \nis not complete and we may have to revive authorization efforts.\n6.  Tracy Ngo has given us a long list of munis, prioritized as to our credit \nexposure to them.  Presumably I am busy checking all of the most serious ones \nout and making sure we have proper authorizations.  In fact, I have done \nnothing with this  because I am busy with other immediate priorities.  \nPat Boylston of Stoel Rives and Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle are \nproviding very valuable service in this area.  They are both very good at \ndealing with these muni type folks and, with the exception of Grant, (and not \nbecause of Pat, who has been great)  have gotten fairly good results so \nfar.----cgy",

Enron has a obligation to the banks under the total return swap confirm for the $30.2MM plus accrued interest (the only dif. is that it does not show up on the balance sheet).  CIBC is at risk for $946K plus yeild if the sale of the asset is less than $31.2 and the origional owner of the asset (ENA) could take a hit if the proceeds of the asset sale does not equal the amount monitized (ie the full $31.2) \n \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tDelacey, Charles  \nSent:\tWednesday, May 02, 2001 3:29 PM\nTo:\tPruett, Steve\nSubject:\tRE: Hawaii Sec 125 Trust\nSteve, Joe was down here when i got your message. He said he had spoken to John about this and would give you a call.  If you still need a memo let me know.  The answer is that there is a obligation of ENE on the swap for $30.2MM but it is not on the balance sheet.

Could one of you confirm with John via email that there is no implicit (or explicit) guarantee to CIBC from Enron on the performance of the investments sold to CIBC.  Am I correct in thinking that CIBC invested +/- $17 MM (3%) of equity in the deal?\nOn a related matter, I informed the CGAS executive team that Enron will initiate a sales process within the next two weeks and will return to Columbus in mid-May with our divestment advisor.  Books would go out in late June, dataroom in July, offers in August and in Q4, possibly late Q3.  Drilling results are strong as is cash flow (2001E EBITDA of $10-11 MM vs. $4.8 MM in 1999, $9.2 MM in 2000), Appalachian gas reserves are of interest to a broader set of participants today than last year, we have a better track record, and E&P companies' access to capital is much better now than it was when we pulled the failed offering this time last year (indicated equity value of $15 MM).  \nTherefore, I am confident Enron will net $2-5 MM more than the sale price to CIBC of $31.2 MM.\nSteven H.

We feel accessing\ninformation by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should\nbe satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.\n[Panus, Stephanie]  While the definition of \"Representative\" is broad, it is limited to those persons who will evaluate, negotiate, and finalize the Transaction.  There may be persons working on this who are from different departments/affiliates.\n2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential\nindefinitely.\n[Panus, Stephanie]  \nWe can agree to a two year term.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you can request the return of all documents submitted to Enron.  The information to be submitted does not retain its value indefinitely.\n3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,\nthe jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.\n[Panus, Stephanie]  We cannot agree to California law, but can agree to New York law.\n4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for\na Confidentiality Agreement.\n[Panus, Stephanie]  We use arbitration for settling all issues other than for injunctive relief.\nLet me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a\nsigned copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for\ndelivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.\nThanks and best regards,\nTimothy O.

Clay and I are living in my parent's backhouse\n(room w/ bathroom and kitchenette over the garage) while we work in Dallas\nfor the summer.  Our number there is 214-691-3638 and Clay's cell is\n214-649-6914.  My work email is jessica.pulliam@bakerbotts.com and my work\nnumber is 214-953-6532.\nHope you all are doing well--I have had a great first few days of work.  But\nthings have been busy as usual--throwing a 50th Birthday party for my mom on\nThursday--\"Come as Jeanie\" (the theme is a suprise)--should be pretty\nfunny!!  On a heavier note, my gradmother Mimi (mom's mom) had a stoke on\nMonday which left her totally paralyzed on one side and unable to eat.  She\ndecided not to go into the hospital (she hadn't been doing too well) so we\nshould lose her in the next couple of weeks--I would appreciate very much\nyour prayers for my family on that front.  I am comforted in that Mimi is\nstill coherent enough to understand what is going on and in that my mom\nseems to be at peace with the whole thing.\nAnyway, Clay and I are great--we are looking forward to a wild summer and I\nhope this note has found you guys doing well.\nMuch love to you all,\nbate",

I would appreciate it if those of =\nyou with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct=\n or clarify anything I've misstated.  Also, please forward this to anyone e=\nlse with an interest in this matter.\nA.  Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the \"Negative CTC\")\n     1.  Background:  The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE =\nare no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers.  P=\nrior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills =\nwould reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges.  SCE and PG&E have=\n now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo=\nr T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in=\n PX Credits.  This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opini=\non of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be col=\nlected as a bill credit, and not in cash.  Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer,=\n expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was i=\nmproper, and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with th=\ne CPUC.  Note:  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which ac=\ncrued to prior to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX=\n Credit accrued during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the p=\nroper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame.  Further=\nmore, PG&E and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the=\n Credit that had accrued as of December 31, 2000.\n    2.   Action Items/Issues:  (a)  With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluatin=\ng filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC.  The CPUC has a=\n process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust=\nomers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an=\n interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equiva=\nlent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an in=\njunction against the utilities disconnecting customers.   While the analysi=\ns is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the=\n CPUC for relief.  (b)  With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluat=\ning whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court.\n    3.  Timing:  Late fees will begin accruing August 20.  The first discon=\nnect notices would not be received until September 19.\n    4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour=\nt to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effec=\nt on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and pr=\nospectively.\nB.  $10 Surcharge\n     1.  Backgound:  Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10=\n surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent,  when ma=\nde permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of =\npower on behalf of the utilities.  This evolution gives rise to two bases f=\nor EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 sur=\ncharge.  First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene=\nration for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct =\naccess should not have to pay it.  This is the same logic that caused the C=\nPUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge.\nSecondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no dir=\nect benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as =\na tax.  Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the del=\nivery point are borne by the customer.  Note:  SCE, unlike PG&E, may not im=\npose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing ma=\nde at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only.\n     2.  Action Items/Issues:  (a)  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead i=\nn advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to =\ndirect access customers at the CPUC.  It may be advisable for an industry g=\nroup rather than Enron to make the filing.  (b)  I would expect that we wou=\nld follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with th=\ne CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected.  In the interim we=\n would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o=\nur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success=\nful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 w=\nhen the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was fi=\nrst imposed.\n     3.  Timing.  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will=\n need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no=\ntices.\n     4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze=\n with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on=\n other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17=\n, and prospectively).=20\nEnd.    =20\n ",

Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).\nMy recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).\nAPS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  \nHaving said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.  \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tShapiro, Richard  \nSent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 6:46 AM\nTo:\tKaufman, Paul\nSubject:\tFW: APS Filing \nThoughts?\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNord, Sue  \nSent:\tMonday, October 22, 2001 5:11 PM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.\nSubject:\tAPS Filing \nAre we (or EPSA) taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort?

The structure\nallowed National Energy Group to get a separate credit rating and\nborrow funds without affecting other units.\n     In its filing, PG&E said creditors may try to link payments\nbetween the utility and the parent to $349 million in capital\ncontributions that PG&E made to National Energy Group in 2000,\nincluding $250 million transferred in the fourth quarter. National\nEnergy Group's investment grade credit ratings, which were\naffirmed following Pacific Gas's April 6 bankruptcy, were based on\nthe assumption that the new structure insulated the assets.\n     ``Bankruptcy law is designed to scrutinize the transactions\nbetween the company and those with inside influence that took\nplace before the bankruptcy filing,'' Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard\nLaw School professor, said prior to the filing. ``You do that so\ncreditors can be compensated.''\n     On Feb. 20, Moody's Investors Service gave the National\nEnergy Group an investment grade long-term rating of ``Baa2.'' The\nratings company said the company's legal structure and independent\nfinancing strategy protect it from PG&E creditors that may attempt\nto force a consolidation or bankruptcy.\n                    Insolvent Transfers\n     Under the federal bankruptcy laws, when a company that's\ninsolvent transfers assets to a parent and gets less than fair\nvalue, the bankruptcy court can unwind the transaction. The court\ncan also undo asset transfers intended either to defraud\ncreditors.\n     PG&E said it couldn't assure that fraudulent transfer claims\nin Pacific Gas's Chapter 11 case wouldn't be successful. If any\nsuch claims do succeed, they may have a significantly adverse\nimpact, the company said. PG&E said it thinks Pacific Gas was\nsolvent when it made payments to the parent and that creditors\nhadn't been defrauded.\n     In some circumstances, bankruptcy judges can undo corporate\nrestructurings. In this case, National Energy Group's assets could\nbe lumped with its parent's and used to pay off creditors.\n     PG&E said such a combination of assets, known as substantive\nconsolidation, ``is an exception rather than the rule.''\n     Another risk is the possibility that California regulators\nmay try and rescind payments that PG&E made to National Energy\nGroup, the parent said in the filing.\n     The California Public Utilities Commission began an\ninvestigation of intercompany payments between all parts of the\nPG&E corporate structure on April 3.\n     The filing disclosed that National Energy Group has more than\n$2.22 billion of short- and long-term debt, including debt to its\nparent, as of Dec. 31.\n     PG&E owns all the stock of the National Energy Group, which\nit used as collateral for a $1 billion loan arranged by General\nElectric Capital Corp. and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. If PG&E\ndefaults on the loan, control of the company would move to the\ncreditors, which may cause a default under certain obligations of\nthe National Energy Group, the filing said.\n--Liz Goldenberg in New York (212) 893-3940 or\nlgoldenberg@bloomberg.net, and Jeff St.Onge in Wilmington,\nDelaware, (302) 984-3362 or jstonge@bloomberg.net, through the San\nFrancisco newsroom, (415) 912-2980/gcb\nStory illustration: For a graph of the Bloomberg PowerMatch\nTrading Index of Northern California power prices, see\n{PMATNPSP <Index> GP D <GO>}.

The capacity of \nthese two 8\" lines is between 40-44 MMCFD, but the LDC load number peaks up \nto 25 MMCFD in September.  If you look at just June, July and August, then \nit's still 22 MMCFD.  If the fuel rates from the catalog are correct at 8.4 \nMMCFD/unit, then we are looking at 17 MMCFD for two LM6000 units.  This puts \nus at utilizing from 39 MMCFD to 42 MMCFD of a system that has between 40-44 \nMMCFD total capacity.  This is way too close for comfort, we need to tighten \nboth our LM6000 fuel numbers, our system capacity numbers and the LDC load \nnumbers.  You need to get confirmation on what the maximum fuel rate will be \nfor two of these units.  I need to get with Jackson Utility to see if their \npeak hour numbers are different from the daily numbers, I'm betting that they \nare.  I need to build a more detailed model of the two 8\" pipelines with the \nLDC loads coming off at the right mileposts, with correct efficiency factors \nfor the pipe.  I'll get the correct efficiency factors for the pipe by \nsimulating an actual flow period on their system.  I'm hoping that they have \ngood historical numbers or are willing to gather data on a typical day for me \nto simulate.  I can take my simulation package up to Tennessee and fine tune \neverything, if needed, or do it here in Houston with email and phone.",

Jim\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  Crawford, Sharon   On Behalf Of Keohane, Peter\nSent: Tuesday, April 03, 2001 6:15 PM\nTo: Derrick Jr., James; Haedicke, Mark\nSubject: Canadian Retail\nJim and Mark, as you know, we have established a retail affiliate within \nEnron Canada known as Enron Direct.  In addition, EES has a Canadian entity, \nEES Canada, which was established for the purposes of entering into some \ncross-border transactions in Canada.  For various reasons, it has been \ndecided to roll Enron Direct into EES Canada reporting, commercially, to Rob \nMilnthorp, who will in turn report to Dave Delainey.  There are two \nlegal/governance-related issues that I wanted to raise with you:\n1. Governance:  As a result, it will be necessary to make various corporate \nre-organizations to EES Canada.  This will include having EES Canada \nestablished as an Alberta corporation, where Enron Canada has, and Enron \nDirect will have, its principal Canadian office.  In relation to this, I was \nconsidering that EES Canada should be organized consistent with Enron Canada, \nwith two Canadian resident nominee directors and Canadian-resident officers.  \nA few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, \ntax-related \"permanent establishment\" issues, that all directors and officers \nof Enron Canada would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada.  \nAccordingly, Enron Canada was re-organized with a nominee board of directors \nconsisting of Rob Milnthorp (as the senior commercial employee) and me (as \nthe senior legal employee) with a Canadian slate of officers being the \nVice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various \ncommercial or commercial-support groups.  I was thinking of doing likewise \nwith EES Canada.  Although I have not yet obtained a copy of the corporate \nrecords for EES Canada, I believe the current directors of EES Canada are Jim \nand an outside lawyer at Blake, Cassels & Graydon in Toronto, Ernest McNee.  \nI am not sure, but it is also likely that various US-based employees of EES \nare designated as the officers of EES Canada.  Would it be appropriate to \nre-organize EES Canada along the same lines that Enron Canada has been \norganized, or do you have concerns?\n2. Law Firm:  Following-up on our conversation last week, I want to confirm \nthat our continued use of Donahue Ernst & Young for this retail project was \n\"grandfathered\" on the basis that they were \"up the learning curve\" on a \nnumber of the contracting, regulatory, licensing and market participation \nissues.  There is one twist, however, with respect to EES Canada.  Although I \nwas not involved, I believe that EES Canada was established to execute on \nsome gas transactions in Ontario with the use of a Blakes partner in Toronto, \nErnest McNee.  However, as the focus of the business initiative in Canada \nwill, at least in the near future, be more involved and predominantly, if not \nentirely, in Alberta; and as Donahue Ernst & Young is involved in regulatory \nproceedings on our behalf with respect to market design issues affecting the \nAlberta gas and power markets, as well as being familiar with the licensing \nand contracting requirements for Enron Direct in Alberta; and given my \nunderstanding that Blakes' involvement with EES Canada has been relatively \nlimited, I think it would make sense to have Donahue Ernst & Young continue \non with this matter.  I am, however, sensitive to Jim's concerns, and \ntherefore wanted your thoughts on the matter.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nRegards,\nPeter",

In Greek and Roman drama, a god lowered by stage machinery to resolve\n      a plot or extricate the protagonist from a difficult situation.\n   2. An unexpected, artificial, or improbable character, device, or event\n      introduced suddenly in a work of fiction or drama to resolve a\n      situation or untangle a plot.\n   3. A person or event that provides a sudden and unexpected solution to\n      a difficulty.\n[New Latin deus ex machina : deus, god + ex, from + machina, machine\n(translation of Greek theos apo mekhanes).]\n   \"In fact the duke acts as the deus ex machina of the piece, working in\n   the background to ensure that everything turns out right and manipulating\n   the characters' actions along the way.\"\n   Robert Nott, Lust, justice and faith, The Santa Fe New Mexican, Jun 23,\n   2000.\nWhen we face a serious crisis we often look upwards for divine intervention.\nIn such hopeless times we pray to the gods to descend from heaven and\ndeliver us from whatever travail prevails. In ancient Greek and Roman drama,\nthe gods literally came down from above, though not from heaven, to help the\nheros of the drama and save the plot.\nAs it turns out, the gods themselves needed a little bit of help coming\ndown. A crane was used to lower a god onto the stage and untangle the plot.\nThus he was known as deus ex machina, literally, a god from a machine. Soon\nthe figurative use of this device in a drama began to be described by the\nsame name. Greek dramatist Euripides (480-406 BC) was particularly fond\nof it. We are all intimately familiar with this device thanks to popular\ncinema. The hero who had supposedly drowned half-way through the story is\nmiraculously revived to accompany the heroine into the sunset.\nThis week we look at more words from the world of literature.       -Anu\nP.S. I'll be in Oahu, Maui & Hawaii Islands and away from my email during\nNov 23 - Dec 2. AWAD will continue, however, there will be no AWADmail.\n.............................................................................\nI do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether\nI am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man. -Chuang Tzu, mystic and philosopher\n(c. 4th century BC)\nQ: Some time ago you featured a quote/word about x in AWAD.

You may alrea=\ndy know this, but here is what I have heard.\nPeoples Energy/Dominion's Elwood plant is currently being inspected and rep=\naired for cracks in the turbine blades.  The problem was explained to me as=\n a result of a new blade grinding process being performed by a third party =\nwhich has affected a large batch (potentially 153 units) of GE FA's (150MW'=\ns).  The Elwood plant is one of the first units to be inspected and repaire=\nd (Dominion had 2 units done prior to Elwood).  The inspection can be done =\non-site but involves removal and non-destructive testing of each blade (the=\nre are 92 blades in this section of the FA) and is subject to availability =\nof replacement blades and trained personnel.  The Elwood plant has taken ap=\nproximately one week working two twelve hour shifts.  One turbine required =\nreplacement of all blades.  GE is currently telling FA customers that they =\nshould conduct inspections at the customer's earliest convenience due to pr=\noblems experienced in testing and through field verifications (Elwood).  Th=\ney have not suggested any failure rates as a result of this problem.  I am =\nassuming that most customers will choose to postpone inspections depending =\non the particular offtake structure. =20\nI will pass along any additional information I hear regarding this situatio=\nn.

On=\n=20\nOctober 5, Edison filed an ex parte request for the immediate suspension of=\n =20\nthe effective date of portions of D.99-10-057 and D.00-03-058.??On  October=\n=20\n6, PG&E filed its support of Edison=01,s request for immediate  suspension =\nof=20\nthe effective dates of the decisions. The motions were filed  because of th=\ne=20\nsignificant undercollections which are being accumulated in their  purchase=\nd=20\npower accounts.\n?\nA ruling has just been issued by ALJ Minkin which directs parties to file =\n=20\nresponses to Edison=01,s and PG&E=01,s ex parte requests for immediate susp=\nension =20\nof certain portions of D.99-10-057 and D.00-03-058.? The judge says, \"In =\n=20\neffect, Edison and PG&E have moved for a stay of certain aspects of these =\n=20\ndecisions.? Consistent with Rule 45(f), responses to motions must be filed =\n=20\nand served within 15 days of the date that the motion was served, unless th=\ne =20\nadministrative law judge sets a different date.? Therefore, responses to =\n=20\nEdison=01,s and PG&E=01,s requests must be filed and served by October 20, =\n 2000.\"\n?\nShe also notes that the utilities' financial information must be provided  =\nby=20\nOctober 17 and provides that, \"Parties have the opportunity to comment on=\n=20\nthe  financial information provided by the utilities and the emergency=20\npetitions  (including the amended petitions) by October 30.\"\n?\nThis suggests that the filing due on the 20th could be primarily  procedura=\nl,=20\ndealing with the propriety of the Commission issuing a stay of  previously=\n=20\napproved decisions.? The filing on the 30th would then deal with  the=20\nsubstance of the emergency requests, as well as making any comments on the =\n=20\nfinancial data provided by the utilities.? This would provide more time to =\n=20\nreview the financial data and work out the details of any \"counter proposal=\n\" =20\nwhich ARM might want to make.? However, we could also deal with substantive=\n =20\nissues in the 10/20 filing.?

We will need to provide the estate with formal documentation (from yourself and/or Jim Fallon) for the transfer of these assets into NETCO (per Vince Kaminski's request). These models have historically been property of the Research Group. We have initiated the process of transferring the ownership of this to a designated IT person within the NETCO organization.(See attached for more detail)\nDeal Processes/Controls - Once Legal/Credit formalize the contract forms we will be using for NETCO, we should discuss a deal approval process to implement. I would assume the old ENA process would be the template we would follow with adjustments to be made for new corporate structure/ownership, appropriate approval levels of transactions,etc. Issue - Will there be a RAC-like group to provide overall deal documentation? I'm sure this issue will be addressed as transactions start to hit the radar and the collective owners of NETCO will sign off on a control process.\nBack Office Execution Capability - Once the structuring models and the risk systems have been formally moved to the new IT enviroment, we will begin testing the models to the risk books to ensure valuation accuracy. We may want to talk about the reporting mechanisms from both the risk system and structuring models to include Cash Flow reporting tools in addition to MTM reporting. This may be a useful tool to front-end manage our cash position/exposure.\nI've also attached a table with details of the above initiatives and estimated timelines. \nPlease call me with questions.\nBerney\nx34784\n  ",

Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush \nEnergy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from \nLisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the \nEnergy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  \nHowever, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate \nopportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of \nthe plan beneficial to Enron.\n \nShort-term opportunities\n$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be \nopportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for \ntechnologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take \nseveral years to approve, there is \"clean coal\" program money available now \nfor FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have \nalready discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we \nhave good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as \nthey see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money \nbecause we are serious about moving technologies to market.   \nClimate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate \nchange R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control \ntechnologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.\nNew Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing \nnew generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities \nwho would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as \nlong as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits \nagainst a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled \n(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look \nat 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term \nchanges to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply \non line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to \nchange NSR.\nA DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term \n(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using \nutilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief \nonly holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power \ndevelopment market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have \ngood advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or \ntechnology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving \nforward with plant modifications or capacity increases.\nAny NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with \nresistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the \nmultipollutant debate -- see below.\nLong Term Opportunities/Advocacy\nMultipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once \nstreamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief \nfrom NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions \ntrading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron \nbusinesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets \nand create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly \nfor generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power \nplants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.\nOur Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that \nachieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for \n3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides \nincentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic \nsafeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to \nEnron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional \nofficials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate \nto go on for at least a few years.\nHere are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're \ninterested.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you \nand anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental \nproposals.\nRegards,\nJeff Keeler\nDirector, Environmental Strategies\nEnron\n(202) 466-9157\nCell Phone (203) 464-1541\nLisa Jacobson\nManager, Environmental Strategies\nEnron\n(202) 466-9176",

Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of \nEnergy Projects, raised the prospect in a Jan. 3 letter to El Paso, saying \nthat modifying the project \"could assist the difficult situation\" now facing \nthe California gas market. \nSpecifically, the Commission has recommended that El Paso amend a pending \napplication in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, \n1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and \nconvert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends \nfrom McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service \na 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line \n2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a \nsystem expansion. \nHowever, \"there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished,\" \nwrote El Paso Vice President Al Clark on Jan. 15. \"El Paso could add \ncompression to the proposed Line 2000 project, or it could replace or \nrecommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon \nin place.\" As a third option, he said El Paso could add new compression to \nits existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. \nThe \"preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of \nthe relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity, \ni.e. where they want to put gas into El Paso's system and where they want the \ngas delivered,\" Clark said. \nAs a \"first step\" towards gauging market support for an expansion, he noted \nthat El Paso on Jan. 12 posted 1.2 Bcf/d of California-bound pipeline \ncapacity for sale effective June 1 of this year. The capacity currently is \nheld by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contracts expire May 31. \nWhen the posting results are known, \"El Paso will determine whether another \nopen season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional \npipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of California.\" \nIf El Paso finds there is an \"unmet demand for additional capacity\" on its \nsystem, the pipeline at that time \"will evaluate whether an expansion of the \nexisting system or a modification of the Line 2000 project, or both, is the \nappropriate means of accomplishing the expansion,\" Clark noted. \nIn the meantime, he urged the Commission to approve El Paso's application for \nthe Line 2000 project as it was filed. Not only will the project \"increase \nthe operational flexibility\" of El Paso's current system, but converting the \nline from oil to gas service will be a \"necessary prerequisite\" to any future \nexpansion of the pipeline's system, according to Clark.

For Click Match activity Clickpaper.com can still be used as planned.  \nSimply, we'll only be invoicing for transaction fees.\nb. For Click Trade activity the following will happen.\n 1.  Physical trading that occurs at any North American Hub developed by \nClickpaper.com, Enron North America, Corp. (ENA) will be the        \nconfirming entity.  I  have asked legal to develop a simple recital statement \nfor the physical confirmation to indicate that the transaction originated as \na         \"Clickpaper.com on-line transaction\".   \n 2.  Physical trading that occurs at any Hub developed for the U.K., Latin \nAmerica, or Asia, has not yet been finalized for legal entity purposes.  My \ndesire is       that we follow the legal entity structure used by EOL on-line \ntrading for Hubs in similar countries.  We'll work that out soon.\nStrictly from an operational point of view the benefits are many but the most \nsignificant is a much simplified mid/back-office effort in order to support \nClickpaper on-line business.  We no longer need to be concerned about setting \nup more portfolio/book i.d.'s for risk books as on-line deals can go into the \nsame risk books used today for pulp and paper.  Intercompany transactions \nbetween Clickpaper.com and ENA are now eliminated for on-line trades which \nsimplifies the confirmation support as well as the downstream financial \nreporting/reconcilation activity that would be required by using \nClickpaper.com as the entity.  \nIf our one to many model is successful, we move to a many to many model.  At \nthat point, all of this changes.  So for now, ENJOY!\nFor now,\nJeff Harbert",

The only potential expense would be to cover travel expenses for the team if you want them to make their presentation in person to management in Houston.  The main commitment we need is a person who will define a project topic for the team and be available for periodic conference calls throughout the semester.  The project sponsor should help guide the team in their research, and provide any internal company data or other contacts within the company who may have information relevant to the topic.  If you feel that a non-disclosure agreement is necessary due the nature of the project topic, you may request that the students sign one.  Dr. Ronn is the faculty advisor for each team, so students use him as a point of reference as well.\n \nSome potential benefits of sponsoring a practicum include:\nAdditional exposure to MBA students interested in pursuing careers in energy.  The project sponsor will get a close look at a handful of students in action (mostly 1st year MBA's), and can identify potential target recruits for internships or full-time hires later on. \n\"Free\" research.  Depending on how you structure the project, the students' results and presentation should be useful to your organization.  For example, I did a practicum with El Paso last year, and we studied their use of Master Limited Partnerships as a vehicle for their midstream business.  We were able to research in depth some questions they wanted to answer but didn't have the time to do themselves.  Our research confirmed some of their \"hunches\", and management was very pleased with the results.\nThe level of interest in practicums among 1st year students is quite high compared to last year (over 40 students responded so far).  So, we would be excited to have Enron as a sponsor this year. (If you would like to sponsor more than 1 team, we would certainly welcome that as well!)\n \nI have attached the original practicum document with some more details in case you do not have a copy.  Let me know if you have any other questions I can answer.\n \nThanks,\nStephen\n \n \n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Elliott, Lexi [mailto:Lexi.Elliott@enron.com]\nSent: Monday, November 05, 2001 1:36 PM\nTo: Stephen Jensen {ifik243}\nCc: Warner, Traci\nSubject: RE: UT MBA Energy Finance Practicum Sponsorship\nStephen:\n \nI am interested in learning more about the sponsorship.

Sponsorships can only be given by the eight trustees of CEFER (the Center for Energy Finance Education & Research).  Dr. Ronn serves as a faculty advisor for each team.\nLexi Elliott suggested that you and Traci would be the appropriate people to contact for such a request.  Could you let me know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring a team next semester, and who my point of contact should be in the event that you would like to participate?  Feel free to contact me if you would like some more details on the program.\nThanks, \nStephen Jensen \n<<EFG Practicum Program.doc>> \nStephen E.

And with concerns about the future of online\nadvertising intensifying throughout the year as one 'Net firm after\nanother lowered their ad-revenue forecasts, DCLK has become one of the\nbiggest losers among large-cap 'Net players. Even with Tuesday's 16% gain\n(to $13.88), DoubleClick is down 89% this year.\nSo why the post-warning spike? Perhaps investors feel DCLK shares already\nhave been discounted enough. With a market capitalization of $1.7 billion,\nDoubleClick is valued at 3.2x trailing 12 months' revenue of $433 million.\nNot a bad price for a company that dominates its sector.\nOr it could be Wall Street expected worse than DoubleClick's Q4 advisory,\nwhich warned that revenues will be 8% to 10% below expectations and that\nthe bottom line will range from break-even to a net loss of 3 cents per\nshare.\nWhile those latter numbers may be well short of consensus Q4 estimates\ncalling for a net profit of 2 cents per share, they hardly are indicative\nthat the sky is falling on DoubleClick. Yet.\nIt looks as if investors will have to wait at least until April for\nevidence that DoubleClick can turn a profit. Until then, don't expect many\ndays like Tuesday for DCLK shares.\nGetting back to PSINet, its nearly 50% gain (or 53 cents) on Tuesday\nhelped slash its year-to-date loss to 94.7% from 96.5%. The layoff of 300\nworkers clearly is intended to help position the company for a sale. In\nNovember, PSINet said it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic\noptions.\nAs a group, the 50 members of the Internet Stock Index, or ISDEX, gained\n6% in the week of trading ended Tuesday, closing at 501. For the year, the\nISDEX has fallen 41.8%.\n/-------------------------------------------------------------------\\\nGUINNESS FLIGHT internet.com TM INDEX FUND\nAccess the Internet with the Guinness Flight internet.comTM Index Fund.\nCreated to track the Internet Stock Index, known as ISDEXc the Fund is\nthe first Internet index fund.

BUSH\nThe last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones.  As our\nnation watched, we were all reminded on a daily basis of the\nimportance of each and every vote.  We were reminded of the\nstrength of our democracy - that while our system is not always\nperfect, it is fundamentally strong and far better than any\nother alternative.\nThe election was close, but tonight, after a count, a recount\nand yet another manual recount, Secretary Cheney and I are\nhonored and humbled to have won the state of Florida, which\ngives us the needed electoral votes to win the election.

BAKER, III\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nShortly after I arrived here some 19 days ago, I said here in\nthis very room that the election process in - Florida and in\nthe country as a whole - needed to conclude with fairness and\nfinality.\nI suggested that everyone step back, pause, and think about\nwhat was at stake.  I warned that there might be no reasonable\nend to the process of counts, challenges and contests if it\nslipped away from us.\nSo here is the account of the past 3 weeks.\nFull statement:\nhttp://www.georgewbush.com/News.asp?FormMode=NR&ID=2139\n_________________________________________________________________\n4\nSTATEMENT BY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER BOB CRAWFORD\nDemocrat Member of Florida's Election Canvassing Commission\nThank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job\nthat you and your office have done during these last almost\nthree weeks since the election.\nThis has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty.\nBut we got the job done, and we got it done right. People\ncalled me and say--particularly from out of state--and say\nwhat's going on down in Florida, and I have to keep reminding\npeople, the only thing that's going on here is that we've got\na razor-thin election for the most important job in the world.\nAnd that's all it is. After all the jokes, after all of the\nanguish, we've just got a close election. And any state that\nhad to go through this would've had the same problems, I think,\nthat we have had.\nBut I think it's over. It should be over. And maybe that's the\nimportant word there, \"should.\" You know, Yogi Berra once said,\n\"It's not over till it's over.'' Well, it's over, and we have a\nwinner, and it's time to move on.\nThere's one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have\nenough legal talent to keep this tied up through  Christmas.\nBut one thing the lawyers can't do for us and one thing the\ncourts can't do for us: They can't bring this country together\nagain.\nAnd while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight,\nit's going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this\ncountry together again, and I hope we can get on with that work\nsoon.\nAnd I'm proud of the job that we've done here in the state.\n_________________________________________________________________\n5\nGORE JUST SPINNING ABOUT SUPREME COURT, SAYS EXPERT\nFox News Channel, 11/26/00\nFOX NEWS' BRIT HUME: \"...does the Gore team not have something\nto work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court\ncoming up on Friday.  That-that creates sort of a period of\ncontinuing, a sort of unfinality if such a word exists.\"\nNATIONAL JOURNAL'S STUART TAYLOR: \"...Unless I'm missing\nsomething that is completely hollow spin.

Bush, but Al Gore hasn't asked them to do anything\nexcept uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done.\nBut I don't think he's in the position to say, \"Oh by the way\ncould you order some more recounts?\"  So I think there is\nnothing, if...Gore runs out of ammunition.

What happened to that guy?  I could have been a cartoonist in another \nlife.  \nI am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China, \nsoon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something \nvery interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the \nairport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by \nyourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that \non this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple \nglasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be \nthere now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out \ntrick or treating.  I bet they look great.\nAs i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality \nand realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the \nceremony yesterday and said, \"What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing \nat a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, \nbreaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The \nPrime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is \nout of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron \nhere) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat \nand I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should \nsee me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home.  \nCan you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even \nimagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than \nthat, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip \nover, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of \nmy life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and \nwondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a \npriest in a former life.\nAnyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this \nairplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although \nI am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the \ninternet.\nI love you and miss you very much.\nEternally,\nMichael\nSee you soon and in time for soccer.\nxxxxxooooo\n  ",

The Drafting  Committee will be redesignated the Executive Committee and the Working  Group called the Membership Group.  New members of the Drafting  Committee will be appointed by the Co-Chairs and ratified by the Membership  Group.  I've attached a revised  organizational plan to reflect these  and other points raised during the conference call.\n \n(2)  The Drafting Committee should meeting sometime  during the first two weeks of November.  Both AEP and Jones Day  have offered to host the meeting in Columbus, Ohio.  The dates under  consideration are 11/6,11/7, 11/8, 11/13, 11/14, or 11/15.  The Drafting  Committee would give final approval for the optional provisions and collateral  annex before they are posted on the EEI website.  In addition, the Drafting  Committee would discuss the future organization of the contract group and a  proposal for non-EEI members to contribute membership fees.\n \n(3) Subject to any objection by those not on the call, Noel  Trask of the Exelon Power Team will be permitted to join the Drafting  Committee.\n \nFinally for those who do not know yet, I will be taking a  position with Constellation Power Source effective November 5.     At this time it is not clear who will be the EEI point of contact for the Master  Contract group.  EEI, however,  is committed to continued sponsorship  of the agreement and related activities.   It is unclear what role I  will have with the group's activities as a Constellation employee.  I've  thoroughly enjoyed working with you over the past three years and hope to stay  in contact with all of you.\n \nRegards,\n \n \n \nAndrew S.

Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)\nOther, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  \nAbout Coppelia\nCopp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: \"Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.\"\nCopp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, \"It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.\" (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)\n\tHeeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay \thomage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in \tthe workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss \t'n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, \tand oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.",

Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana. \nDunn wants to know why Terry Winter, the man in charge of the state's power grid, defied his board of directors and Gov. Gray Davis when he asked federal regulators to remove key price caps. \nA spokesman for Winter said that the limits were causing energy producers to abandon California and that Winter acted to keep the state from plunging into darkness. \nBut with the price ceilings eliminated, energy prices soared and California's three electricity utilities began tumbling toward insolvency -- forcing the state to begin buying power with taxpayer dollars, according to Dunn. \n\"The way things unfolded in December are very suspicious, and they directly led to the disaster that struck in January,\" said Dunn, chairman of a special Senate committee investigating energy market manipulation. \nWinter, who is president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operator, and 15 others will be required to provide sworn testimony in depositions. They also must provide e-mail messages, notes and phone records. \nThe others facing subpoenas include high-level ISO management officials and current and former board members. \nThe ISO board, which had members who worked for energy producers, was accused by many of being too cozy with power providers and was replaced in January by a five-member panel appointed by Davis. \nDunn hopes to retrace events surrounding some of the peak days of the state's energy crisis. \nThe ISO board had throughout the year lowered the limits at which energy producers could sell power. Price controls that were set at $750 per megawatt were reduced dramatically by October. \nBut soaring natural gas prices greatly increased the costs of producing electricity, and by the end of the month, generators sent a flurry of letters to the Federal Energy Commission urging an end to price limits. \nBy December, electricity producers were not interested in selling power to California utilities at rates that meant they would lose money, said Gregg Fishman, an ISO spokesman. \n\"The market was completely dysfunctional at that point,\" Fishman said. \"There was no energy being bid. We're supposed to keep the lights on, so something had to be done.\" \nOn Friday, Dec. 8, without telling ISO board members or the governor, Winter and other top ISO managers sent a 50-page request to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission officials asking that they make an emergency ruling and drop price caps. The commission, which had outlined a plan in November to end the price limits, approved the request. \nGenerators were allowed to charge more than $250 per megawatt as long as they could prove their costs. \nAverage prices the utilities paid for electricity shot up from $484 per megawatt on Dec. 5 to $677 per megawatt on Dec. 11. Less than a month later, the state began buying power for cash-strapped utilities, which couldn't afford the high prices. \n\"They (ISO officials) poured gasoline on a fire,\" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. \nAlthough Winter, who serves at the pleasure of the board, was acting within ISO rules during an emergency, the governor and some power grid board members were outraged at the behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Dunn wants to know whether the ISO and energy producers campaigned together to eliminate the price limits. \n\"I was appalled we weren't consulted about something so significant,\" said Michael Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on the ISO board. \"It was bad judgment at the very least.\" \nFlorio, one of those subpoenaed by Dunn's committee, said the ISO board met the next week to discuss Winter's actions, but he said a majority of board members didn't want to get rid of the president of the power grid in the middle of a crisis. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubpoenaed \nThe 16 people subpoenaed in the state Senate investigation of energy market manipulation are: \nSTAFF MEMBERS:\nTerry Winter, ISO president and chief executive officer \nKellan Fluckiger, ISO chief operations officer \nAnjali Sheffrin, ISO director of market analysis \nJim Detmers, ISO vice president of grid operations \nElena Schmid, ISO vice president of corporate and strategic development \nFORMER ISO BOARD MEMBERS\nBarbara Barkovich \nGregory Blue \nJohn Fielder \nMichael Florio, still serves \nKaren Johanson \nCarolyn Kehrein \nJan Smutny-Jones \nV.

The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the Bridge\nagreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this\nmorning's meeting. \nMuch of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement. There\nwas some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge\nagreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas on\nDecember conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions entirely\nbut questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and\nChristophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to promote\nuse of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.  \nIn addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile to\nalso have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European\nactivities and to begin discussion on the December agenda. ISDA should begin\nto focus on an agenda as soon as possible so that we assure December's\nconference is as productive as the Houston conference.

I will try and stay in the\nloop as best I can.  Thanks for everyone's help in resolving this issue.\nDS\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Franson, Rob\" <RFranson@czn.com>@ENRON  \nSent:\tFriday, December 14, 2001 3:15 PM\nTo:\tdschool@enron.com\nCc:\tSchoolcraft, Darrell; Breen, Sean\nSubject:\tRequested pressure cut at Citizens Griffith TW Interconnect\nCitizens had concerns about the amount of noise and vibration at our Citizens Plant Station and has recently had an expert on this subject visit the site and take measurements.  The preliminary report indicates that the current configuration could potentially fail at full load conditions with a inlet pressure exceeding 740 psig.  Since Citizens does not want to limit the capacity of the power-plant, we are asking that your delivery pressure be temporarily reduced to 700 psig.\nI have attempted to document the different operation modes that we have observed your station operating under along with any back-ground information that I was able to document. As discussed, in the design phase of this interconnect, I was informed that batching would only occur under low flow conditions, and do not understand the benefit of batching in the manner that was done earlier this year.\nPer our customers request (Griffith Energy) Citizens installed equipment capable of measuring down to extremely low flow rates that include three measurement runs.  A 10\" Instrument Ultrasonic, a 4\" Invensys Turbine meter, and a 2\" Instrumet Rotary meter.  Although I questioned this requirement at the time, the low flow condition occurs so rarely, it is inconsequential.\nI have analyzed our log files for the month of November (11/1/01-12/6/01) and found that the only time the smaller runs operate is momentarily as the power plant starts up.  The following volumes are accumulated totals per run for this time period.\nRun Size        TW      Flow (Mcf)     Percent of Flow                              EPNG    Flow (Mcf)        Percent of Flow \n2\"                                   107.9              0.0089%                          0.2            0.0018% \n4\"                      1,280.8              0.1059%                                                 2.1                  0.0153%\n10\"                         1,208,076.9            99.8852%                                          13,714.4                99.9829%\nMy point is that in the event that you do not feel comfortable in setting your actuated valve immediately downstream of your flow control valve to take Citizens' requested pressure cut, consider temporarily using the flow control valve as  pressure control.  The month of November included considerable power-plant testing, and therefore the above numbers are higher that during commercial operation.\nWhen TW found it's in a difficult situation in regards to finding a solution to measuring a low flow (which appears to be erroneous information), Citizens worked with you in good faith.  All we are asking is the same in return.\n <<Griffith-TW-Chrono.xls>> \n - Griffith-TW-Chrono.xls ",

We will enclose the pledge form and=20\nan Enron matching gifts form for your convenience.\nOur meeting with Bob May, Dean of the McCombs School of Business at=20\nUT-Austin, was a great success.  We had 14 attendees who received an update=\n=20\nfrom Bob about the many great things going on in Austin, as well as=20\nopportunities to participate in the =01&We=01,re Texas=018 capital campaign=\n.\nAfter Bob=01,s presentation, the 14 Enron officers met separately and were=\n=20\nextremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner=\n=20\nto the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in=20\ngiving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!\nHere is what we propose and how it would work.\n1. The UT Alumni at Enron would pledge $1 million over four years to the=20\nMcCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and=\n a=20\nmatching $500,000 from Enron.\n2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business=\n=20\nSchool would match the $1 million.\n3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million =01&Enron Chair=018=\n to=20\nsupport =01&star quality=018 faculty for the school.  This will represent o=\nne of=20\nthe largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.\nA few additional details:\n1. Each individual=01,s contribution will also be credited to their name (a=\nlong=20\nwith the Enron match) for recognition purposes in Business School=01,s Annu=\nal=20\nReport, President=01,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribu=\ntion=20\nmatched by Enron will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that=20\nindividual for recognition purposes.\n2. Enron has agreed to not count it=01,s match against an employee=01,s ann=\nual=20\nmatching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in =\na=20\nway that makes it a part of the =01&Enron Chair=018.\n3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the =01&=\nWe=01,re=20\nTexas=018 campaign as long as that pledge is not supporting a separately na=\nmed=20\ncontribution.  Please let us know that this is your intent.\nPlease carefully consider this request.  I do not plan to finalize the pled=\nge=20\nuntil I receive responses from enough officers to support this contribution=\n. =20\nWe have about 40 officers of Enron who are UT alumni and with some=20\nparticipation by each of us, we will achieve this level of gift.  Our plans=\n=20\nare to follow this up with a broader opportunity for all Enron employees th=\nat=20\nare UT alumni; however, the leadership of the group will determine our=20\nsuccess.\nThanks for your consideration and continuing support of The University of=\n=20\nTexas.",

This was done because \nthe project was placing a $20MM IPO locally and it was not possible to \ncomplete the IPO before the debt financing.  The IPO has been successfully \nsubscribed; however, Enron has been blocking the transfer of the IPO funds \ninto the project company as we must have certain minor share transfers \ncompleted prior to the transfer of the IPO funds in order to solidify our \nU.S. tax deferral structure.  \nOne of the covenants of the debt financing is that we must maintain a certain \ndebt to equity ratio in order to be able to draw more debt.  The project has \nnow reached the point in which it can no longer draw debt proceeds until the \nremaining $20MM of equity (the IPO funds) are transferred into the project \naccount as these equity funds are required in order to allow for our \ndebt/equity ratio to be preserved.  The timing of this issue is being driven \nby the fact that the project has to pay interest and commitment fees to the \nbank on the 3rd of January.  The only source of these payments are the IPO \nfunds that must be transferred.\nAs mentioned above, Enron requires several minor share transfers in order to \npreserve the U.S. tax deferral structure (5 or 10 shares need to be exchanged \nin several companies in the chain).  These transfers must take place before \nthe IPO funds are put into the Project Company.  The language of these minor \ntransfers have been agreed among the partnership.  However, the partners are \nrefusing to execute these minor transfers until Enron executes the Transfer \nAgreement.\nWhen the Gaza project was being conceived, the former CALME management agreed \nto the Transfer Agreement and this agreement was memorialized in detail in \nthe Joint Venture Agreement among the parties.  The Transfer Agreement \nprovides no party may have a change in control of their ownership in the \nproject without the consent of the other parties.  The JVA expressly states \nthat this transfer restriction is to be entered into by Enron Corp. and that \nthe restrictions on change of control apply all the way up the ownership \nchain to Enron Corp. as well as to the other partners ultimate parent \nentities.  \nA draft of this Transfer Agreement has been previously reviewed by Mark \nMetts.  Mark indicated that he was not comfortable with the nature of the \nagreement; however, this was last summer when Enron was re-evaluating its \nposition with respect to its international assets and it was thought that the \nGaza project may have soon not been part of Enron.   \nThe Gaza team has spent a great deal of time over the past six months trying \nto either soften the nature of the Transfer Agreement or to make the \nrestriction apply to some entity lower in the ownership chain than Enron \nCorp.  These efforts have been unsuccessful as the partners claim that the \nTransfer Agreement was a \"pillar\" of the deal that we had and furthermore \nthat this deal had been agreed directly with very senior Enron personnel.\nTherefore, it appears that we must deal with the Transfer Agreement now in \norder to allow Enron to preserve its tax deferral position, transfer the IPO \nfunds and ultimately allow the project to meet its debt service obligations \nto the bank on January 3rd.  We have tried to bring this issue to a close \nsooner, but the parnters have delayed resolution until now.  The timing of \nthis is unfortunate, but probably not accidental from our partners position.\nYou may reach me at any time at 502.458.4985 (through Thursday afternoon) or \nat 713.522.4802 (home) or 713.818.9019 (mobile) beginning Thursday evening.  \nI appreciate your giving this attention during the holidays.\nAndrew",

I realize it has been a \nwhile since we first spoke about this point. \nI have reviewed the concern about hackers and Enron use of Passwords and the \nbest we can do is insert language into the Password App. similar to that \nappearing in the attached document (which is the same type of language used \nin the ETA's).  It is intended only to cover the situation where Clickpaper \npersonnel use the password or otherwise access the website, in an \nunauthorized manner, on behalf of a counterparty.  The language does not \naddress the hacker situation as we place the burden in that situation upon \nthe counterparty.\nFinally, since the Password App. is a legal, electronic agreement, any \namendments or modifications for a counterparty must come through my office or \nthrough Tana Jones ((x. 33399).  Accordingly, those counterparties who have \nraised the issue should call either one of us if further action is \nnecessary.  We do not actually revise the form agreements, but do provide \nside letters indicating modifications to the form agreement.\nOnce again, please accept my apologizes for the delay.

Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh\nIN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY\nConstrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas\nprices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the\nCalifornia Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the\nissue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state.\nAfter taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others,\nthe report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. ?Insufficient receipt capacity\nwithin California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted\nto the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000,? the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is\nscheduled to vote Wednesday on the report.\nThe revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame\nentirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels\nduring times of high gas prices. ?As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California,\nbuyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in\nwhole or in part, the result of a free market?s rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or\nentirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report,? wrote Commissioner Michal\nMoore, presiding member of CEC?s electricity and natural gas committee.\nPointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the\nCEC added that it had ?every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented\nby the CPUC.?\nThe report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El\nPaso system in recent years. ?The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream\ncustomers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to\nfirm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment\nto deliver capacity paid for by California,? the report noted.\nMoore?s committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version\nfrom the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for\nconsideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug,\n1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the\nrange of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4).\nThe report went on to suggest that California ?can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a\nregulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme\ntemperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today?s conditions, that is no longer the case.?\nMoore added that the state?s ?virtual complete reliance? on gas for electric generation has contributed to\nthe new dynamics surrounding capacity planning.\nMore than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council\nregion demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was ?encour-aged?\nby recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC?s stated intent to expedite\nreview of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/\nday of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric\nCo. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report.\nIt observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full\ncapacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate\npipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001.\nHigh prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUC?s recent approval\nof SoCal Gas? plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and\nAliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County (IF, 2 July, 3).\nIn addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs, the report recommended that the state ?analyze\nthe consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the\nflows of natural gas and electricity? between California and the Southwest U.S. and Mexico.\nAccording to the report, the state also should: encourage in-state gas production; re-evaluate design criteria\nfor the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand; consider gas curtailment\nmechanisms; ?optimize? storage; and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state.\nThe 123-page report is available on the CEC?s Web site (www.energy.ca.gov/reports/index.html).\nThe attachment below is the final CEC Infrastructure report:\n <<FinalCECInfraRpt.pdf>> ",

While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single\nnumber for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the\nold way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that\nmost if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the\nsummer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should\nbe possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten\nyears.\nNYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that\nresulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and\nLong Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter\nratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how\nmuch the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the\nstatewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter\nrequirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,\nrespectively.\nWhile this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter\nlocational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some\nreduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a\nconsideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP\nrequirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement\nfor summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the\nrespective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.\nNYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in\nan effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination\nof locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We\nwould appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.\n<<NYPA_LR_wint.PDF>>  <<TRAN_SYS_001129.PDF>>",

Enron bears this tax obligation under the Sales Agreement pur=\nsuant to which we sold the Peakers to Allegheny (effectively, this tax liab=\nility is a \"pre-acquisition date\" tax liability that we, as the seller, are=\n responsible for).  Typically, the equipment used to construct the Peakers =\nwould be assessed Sales/Use tax when purchased by the Project company that =\nbuilt the respective Peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to =\nthe buyer in a sale such as that to Allegheny.  The EWS Tax Department stru=\nctured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the Sale=\ns/Use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time (for example, a sales=\n-leaseback strategy was employed in Illinois to spread the cost of the Sale=\ns/Use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up =\nfront).  Ultimately, we benefitted from this since we did not use as much c=\nash in constructing the Peakers and earned more from the disposition of the=\n Peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have (an=\nd we believe did in the specific case of Allegheny) modelled the cost of th=\ne Peakers as including the full current payment of such Sales/Use tax.  Tha=\nt said, we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from t=\nhe sale of the Peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitati=\nons related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the ab=\nove described results expires since there is risk that our position could b=\ne challenged and, if challenged, there is a risk that we would not prevail.=\n  Matt is out until May 8 (he is a recent father of a baby girl) but upon h=\nis return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you wou=\nld like.

The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.\nI hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.\nIf you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.\nRegards,\nKevin",

I know that Foster spent some time on the \nphone with Steve and Mark before writing the article. \n----- Forwarded by Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT on 06/26/2001 08:40 AM -----\n\tDan Dorland\n\t06/08/2001 08:54 AM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Paul Devries/TOR/ECT@ECT, Jan Wilson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Jeff Borg/TOR/ECT@ECT, \nDave Ellis/TOR/ECT@ECT, Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Garrett Tripp/TOR/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: Economics 90210\nEconomics 90210\nPeter Foster\nNational Post\nDumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task \nthis week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so \nnaive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price \ncontrols. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just \"Econ 101.\" \nWhat the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the \nDepartment of Sarah Polley-Sci.\nThe bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in \nthe federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with \nthem more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a \nscrewed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to \nnew state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and \nprofiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.\nThe call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a \"gang \nof ten\" economists including Alfred Kahn, \"the architect of airline \nderegulation under President Carter.\" But price caps don't work. As President \nBush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, \"[P]rice \ncaps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply.\" \nHowever, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we \nshouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway, \nand in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose \narrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.\nApart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more \nobjectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his \nsupport for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of \npower suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time \nagain -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be \n\"just enough\" to call forth the right amount of new power. \"Nobody,\" he \nwrites, \"has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power \nproducers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce \nthe power supply?\"\nMr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn \nthat \"strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies \nonly to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need \nnot cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually \nlead to higher output.\" This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up \nhis hands and says \"No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you \nclever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And \nwhich way is it to the airport?\"\nProfessor Krugman does have the good grace to note that \"That's not an \nargument you want to use too often.\" In fact, the argument is dangerous \nnonsense. There is no \"monopoly\" supplier of energy to California (although \nmany state politicians have called for a government takeover of the \n\"commanding heights\" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both \nthe economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as \never. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices \nmeans that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have \nto be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it \nwas under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that \nbrought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of \nsuch essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing \nof market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the \nspectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective \nceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except \nfor those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that \"generating \ncapacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut.\" \nIf that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for \nprice supports.\nMr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that \nCalifornia's problems are all due to market \"manipulation\" by big energy \nsuppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide \nassertion that President Bush's \"knee-jerk ideologue\" advisers may be \"so \nclose personally to energy industry executives that they believe that \nwhatever is good for Enron is good for America.\" The presence in California \nof Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the \nstate, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer, \nEnron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise \ncampaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business \nexecutives somehow go together nicely.",

Supreme Court to review qui tam standing this\tterm\nBody: \nThis action by the U.S. Supreme Court may be very good news for the Grynberg \ncase.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 11/22/99 \n06:31 AM ---------------------------\nDawne Davis <DDAVIS@HOLLANDHART.COM> on 11/20/99 04:05:29 PM\nTo: \ncc: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: News Flash!  Supreme Court to review qui tam standing this term\nWe received this news flash courtesy of John Boese.\n CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT:  SUPREME COURT ORDERS BRIEFING ON CONSTITUTIONALITY \nOF QUI TAM ENFORCEMENT\n In a surprise announcement, the Supreme Court yesterday indicated that it \nwill determine this term whether a private individual (known as a\"relator\") \nwho files a qui tam False Claims Act cases has standing to bring such a case.\n In an FCA case already fully briefed and ready for argument on November 29,  \nVermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel Stevens, No. \n98-1828, the court had granted certiorari to determine two issues:  (1)  \nwhether states have immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from FCA suits \nbrought by qui tam relators, and  (2) whether states are \"persons\" subject to \nFCA liability.  Yesterday,  the Supreme Court issued an order\ninstructing the parties to file, by November 30, additional briefs on the qui \ntam relator's standing to bring an FCA suit.  A panel of the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals recently issued an opinion declaring qui tam enforcement \nunconstitutional, a ruling that would have created a conflict among the \ncircuits.  See, United States ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, \nNo. 97-20948, 1999 WL 1034216  (5th Cir. Nov 15, 1999), discussed in \nFraudMail Alertc 11-15-99 and FraudMail Alert No. 99-11-18.  In a split \ndecision, the Fifth Circuit panel ruled  that when the government declines \nintervention, qui tam enforcement of the FCA violates the Take Care Clause of \nthe Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine.  However, that ruling \nwas vacated and the Riley case is now before the full Fifth Circuit for en \nbanc review.\n The constitutionality of qui tam enforcement has been hotly debated since \nthe watershed amendments to the False Claims Act in 1986 significantly \nexpanded the rights and powers of qui tam relators.  Every district court to\nconsider the issue, and five (5) courts of appeals, had concluded that qui \ntam enforcement is constitutional, albeit on conflicting (and sometimes \ninexplicable) grounds.  Judge Hoyt's ruling in Riley was the first district \ncourt opinion holding that  qui tam enforcement is unconstitutional.  The\nDistrict Court in Riley concluded that the qui tam relator lacked standing to \nsue under the FCA because he had suffered no injury in fact.  See Riley v. \nSt. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 982 F. Supp. 1261 (S.D. Tex 1997).  The\nFifth Circuit panel affirmed this ruling, but on different constitutional \ngrounds.  It was hoped that on rehearing en banc the Fifth Circuit would also \nfind the qui tam provisions unconstitutional, and would create a conflict in \nthe circuits to require Supreme Court review of this constitutional issue. \nThe Supreme Court's order yesterday in the Stevens\ncase indicates that the Court intends to expedite that consideration and \nresolve at least the standing issue this term.\n One final note:  while it is surprising that the constitutional issue would \nbe raised by the Court at such a late date, the issue is not new to the \nStevens case.  In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Stevens, \n162 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 1999), Judge Jack B. Weinstein, sitting by\ndesignation, issued a lengthy dissent from the panel decision both on the \nissue of Eleventh Amendment immunity and on the separation of powers and \nstanding issues even though the Second Circuit had ruled in 1993 that qui tam \nenforcement was constitutional.  See, U.S. ex rel. Kreindler & Kreindler v. \nUnited Technologies Corp., 985 F. 2d 1148 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 113 S. Ct. \n2962 (1993).  And, of course, it is not unusual for the court to question \nstanding at any time.\nFraudMail Alertc No. 11-20-99",

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in \nthe Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved \nand a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely \ndifficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were a rumors circulating \nthrough the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to \nmost of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out \nto employees, but basically we said the following:\n 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to \nredeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has \nexposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not \nenvisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are \nplacing EOGIL in the market.\n 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we \nwill be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron \nentities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL \ntransaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  \n 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global \nE&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.\n 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. \n  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process\n  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale \nprocess\n  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and \ncoordination with our bankers and Corporate Development\n 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told \nthem it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a \nPSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many \npeople will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers \nor through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with \nthe assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated \nMarch 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide \ntransition services to a buyer.\n \nI would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were \nfor sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in \nthe media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike \nStewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can \nbe reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed \non our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be \ntraveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be \navailable all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) \n713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest \ntalking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.\nThis afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our \nintention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to \nvisit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two \nweeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries \nfrom our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.

The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our \nesteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to\ntell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first \ngame.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably \nwouldn't\nhave won anyway.  \nHere is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this \nmeans that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.\nTake note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the \nlocation has changed.

When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.\nThis is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.  \nCheryl Johnson\nEnron Net Works\nGlobal Data Management\n713.853.3103",

All of these applications are tightly \nintegrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would \nseparate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and \nwould be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity \nand integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it \nwould be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as \nmaintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the \nmarketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate \napplication images would not be good from an overall migration as well as \nsupport standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is \nalso integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning \non a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all \nare looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and \nwould require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.\nRegarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but \nwe need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources \nfrom the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and \ndatabase administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the \nprocess of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be \npossible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If \nwe can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of \nthese options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on \nsharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these \napplications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most \ntimely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from \nLegal regarding this issue?  Thanks.",

I hope all of you have been watching=\n your food intake like  I have, because I certainly intend to eat my fair s=\nhare of the Thanksgiving  feast!!!  And that brings me to the most asked qu=\nestion from last weekend,  \"Hey, Christopher, with all this great wine, wha=\nt will YOU be drinking on  Thanksgiving?\"  Before I reveal my T-day sampler=\n case, I wanted to let you  know what types of food we will pairing these w=\nines with.  We usually start  with some type of shellfish, some mild, some =\nspicy.  For my family and  friends who don't do shellfish, we also offer so=\nme traditional stuff such as the  best stuffed eggs I have ever tasted (tha=\nnks to Martha, don't you know), and  assorted cheeses and crackers.  Then c=\nomes the main course: TUR-DUC-KEN  (always from our friends at La Boucherie=\n), with all the 'fixins': jalepeno  cornbread stuffing, traditional stuffin=\ng with sage, and a pile of different  veggies.  Naturally, dessert is prepa=\nred, but we usually stick to pretty  simple, fairly tame ones, like pumpkin=\n pie or pumpkin something.  This is  where the Riesling from the sampler ca=\nse comes in.  It is also amazing with  the shellfish.  To make this meal a =\nsmashing success, I have selected the  following sampler case of 12 bottles=\n:\nCHRISTOPHER'S PERSONAL THANKSGIVING  SAMPLER (2 BTLS EACH): =20\nBaron Foulon Sauvignon Blanc 2000 =20\n                (classic  Sauvignon Blanc, very similar to expensive Sancer=\nre) 87 points =20\nEstate GH von Mumm Rheingau Dry Riesling 1999 =20\n                (FABULOUS,  semi-dry Riesling, like a crisp red apple) 88 p=\noints =20\nChateau LaCroix Martelle Minervois 1999 =20\n                (you  may remember this, my house red, serious Syrah) 89 po=\nints =20\nDomaine Capouilleres Ventoux 1998 =20\n                (so  full of blue fruits, loves the spicy stuff) 87 points =\n=20\nDomaine du Pain de Sucre Pinot Noir 1997 =20\n                (packed  with the most amazing Pinot fruit, tastes like a $=\n35 Burgundy) 88 points =20\nLes Magnans Vacqueyras 1998 =20\n                (from  our current web-site newsletter, serious Grenache, t=\nhink Chateauneuf-du-Pape) 88  points\nTo make your gathering extra special, I have decided to offer this  high-qu=\nality sampler at a price you will never see again!!!\nNormally, this  case would run close to 200 bucks!!!\nTHIS WEEK,  ONLY, ENJOY THE SPECIAL HOLIDAY PRICE OF: $163 PLUS TAX,  EACH\nPlease call us as soon as you are able, I have only a  couple of dozen of t=\nhese special cases available.\nHave your card number ready  and call me at 713-524-9144 to order. =20\n\"Christopher, I know I saw  the subject above.

Fialka\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n08/24/2000\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nWASHINGTON -- The Clinton Administration and federal energy regulators \nstepped up efforts to respond to a\npolitically disastrous rise in California electricity prices, threatening to \ngo as far as re-regulating some prices if they\ndetermine that the free-market experiment in the state has failed. \nThe moves by federal authorities come as California regulators and lawmakers \nscramble to come up with an\nexpedient solution to high power prices in the San Diego area, where monthly \nbills have in some cases quadrupled\nsince last summer.\nIn a 21-page order issued yesterday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nsaid that under the Federal Power\nAct it can intervene to limit the prices charged by generators to the \nCalifornia market -- if it determines the prices\nthey are charging aren't \"just and reasonable,\" and the market is not \n\"workably competitive.\" \nThe order accompanied an upgrade of the FERC's effort from a staff probe to a \nformal investigation, requested by\nPresident Clinton, who also yesterday extended $2.6 million in federal \nemergency loans to low-income residents in\nthe San Diego area to help pay their electric bills. \n\"There is a crisis of confidence in California wholesale electricity markets \nthat threatens to erode the political\nconsensus necessary to sustain a market-based approach to regulation,\"William \nMassey, one of four FERC\ncommissioners, said yesterday in an opinion attached to the order. \"In these \ncircumstances, the FERC must act\nforcefully and decisively to . . . insist that jurisdictional wholesale \nmarkets produce consumer benefits and just and\nreasonable rates.\" \nAs prices have risen, power generators such as Duke Energy Co., the local \nutility, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.\nand public officials have all pointed the finger at one another for what \nappears to be a badly flawed market. California\ngovernor Gray Davis, who is pushing for local legislation that would lower \nbills and accelerate power-plant\nconstruction, yesterday said \"out-of-state generators\" were most responsible \nfor \"bringing San Diego residents to\ntheir knees.\" \nFERC's action yesterday originated in a complaint filed Aug. 2 by San Diego \nGas & Electric Co, a unit of Sempra\nEnergy, the utility whose customers have riased the most outrage over the \nrate rises. \nThe utility sold off its plants and now buys all the power its customers use \nout of a state-sanctioned auction,\npassing those market costs directly through to its customers. \nSteve Baum, Sempra Energy chairman, said FERC's action is a warning to \ngenerators \"that the prices they've been\nreceiving are now at risk.\" He expects FERC to eventually issue a ruling that \nCalifornia's market isn't competitive,\nsetting the stage for a possible return to cost-based rates in periods of \nhigh demand. Prior to deregulation in 1998,\nthe rates utilities charged for electricity were based on their underlying \ncost. Deregulation allowed them to charge\nwhatever the market would bear. \nMr. Clinton said the the FERC investigation would allow Washington to \"better \nunderstand\" what is happening in the\nCalifornia market so the government can protect consumers there and in other \nderegulated states. \nWhile politicians and regulators seek solutions, wholesale power prices in \nCalifornia are becoming more aberrant. \nEven on days when consumption and prices normally drop, such as Sundays, \nprices have been stubbornly high this\nsummer. For example, the auction price of electricity to be consumed at 10 \np.m. last Sunday was $125.48 per\nmegawatt, or more than four times the price such power commanded on the third \nSunday of August in 1999. The\nmarkup is especially noteworthy because actual demand on that day was 12% \nlower than on the comparable day a\nyear earlier. \n\"A number of people are looking at the high prices trying to figure out \nwhat's going on,\" says Jesus Arredondo,\nspokesman for the state-sanctioned entity that runs the state's day-ahead \nenergy auction, the California Power\nExchange in Pasadena, Calif. \nThese prices have remained high despite the best efforts of public officials. \nFor instance, the organization that runs\nthe state's electric grid and is responsible for keeping consumers constantly \nsupplied with electricity has reduced\nthe maximum price it will pay for electricity this summer to $250 per \nmegawatt hour from $750. While this action\nhas capped peak prices, it has also caused an increase in the overall number \nof hours in which prices are\nabnormally high. \nTake yesterday for instance. Prices for power in California never dropped \nbelow $108 per megawatt hour, even for\npower contracted for delivery in the dead of night, and the hourly price was \nat or above $200 in 13 of 24 hours\ndespite only moderately high demand. \nCalifornia's problems are likely to step up pressure on Congress to pass \nomnibus legislation which would provide\nuniform national rules for deregulated state energy markets and make more \nefficient the interstate\npower-transmission system, Mr. Clinton said yesterday. \nThe administration has pushed for such a measure but the House Commerce \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction\nover the legislation, still appears deadlocked on the details. It plans to \nhold a hearing in California on\nelectricity-market conditions there next month. \n--- \nMarc Lifsher contributed to this article \n--- \nJournal Link: See video of President Clinton announcing emergency funds to \nhelp low-income families in California\npay electricity bills, in the online Journal at WSJ.com.\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He explained his  letter to me. I told him \nthat I was under the impression that the issue over the  transfer documents \nwas resolved in favor of a schedule. He said that he was not  aware of that. \nWhen I asked him point blank whether Brazos was declaring a  default, he \nreferred me to Pat Long. \n?\nI just got off the phone with Pat. I asked Pat if  the letter was a \"default \nletter\" or?a letter in the nature of \"an order to  show cause why Brazos \nshould not declare Tenaska in default\".? He answered  that it was the latter. \nI also asked him if my recollection of how the transfer  document issue has \nbeen resolved was correct and he confirmed that it was.  Hence, you only need \nto produce a schedule showing who owns Tenaska and its  partners and what \noptions exist to acquire ownership or additional ownership  interests in \nTenaska and its partners. As Dan  thought that Rick would be the one to \nprepare the schedule, he asked me to send  a copy of this email to Rick. \n?\nFor your information, they would like to know how  much the new players paid \nfor the interests in Tenaska.\n?\nPat also said that?the Limited Waiver  Agreement that I sent out this morning \nwas fine with him but that Phil had two  minor changes that I would receive \ntomorrow. Hence, please respond to that  document tomorrow so we can get that \nout of the way.\n?\nFinally, as some of you know, tomorrow I will be  sending out a draft of what \nI hope will become an agreed upon statement of the  issues that need to be \nresolved in order to properly analyze the damage issue. I  would appreciate a \nrapid turn-around on that document.\n?\nWhile I am in Houston, I would like to meet with  Carl and Rick.

Holy Spirit,\nI ask You to\nminister\nto their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is\npain, give them\nYour\npeace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,\nrelease a renewed\nconfidence\nin Your ability to work through them.  Where there is\ntiredness, or\nexhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,\npatience, and\nstrength as\nthey learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is\nspiritual\nstagnation,\nI ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,\nand by drawing them\ninto\ngreater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,\nreveal Your love, and\nrelease to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin\nblocking them,\nreveal\nit, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless\ntheir finances,\ngive\nthem greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends\nto support, and\nencourage them.  Give each of them discernment to\nrecognize the demonic\nforces around them, and reveal to them the power they\nhave in You to\ndefeat\nit.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.\nIn Christian love,\nYour Friend in Jesus.\nPassing this on to anyone you consider a friend will\nbless you both.\nPassing this on to one not considered a friend is\nsomething I know\nChrist\nwould do.\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTalk to your friends online with Yahoo!

Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?\nYou had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for\nyou.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth\nstreet close to halloween, even more freaks come out.\nOK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about\nwednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably\nnever see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.\nMy personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss\nout on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night\nand didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing\nthat I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be\nintimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where\nsomebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is\nsmart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether\nyour at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about\nyou is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way\nbecause I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I\nwould have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here\nwriting this email.\nWhen I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that\nhard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a\nchange.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.\nPeople bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect\nyou sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the\nmost are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes\nthe toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest\nthing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad\nbut the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next\nto each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier\nknowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were\nthose couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also\nknew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to\nget involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.\nAlright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that\nI'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share\nthis info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person\nwill never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are\nstacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your\nunder a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The\none thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still\nlooking then you need not look any further.\nSo I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk\nto you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know\nwhere to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene\nHall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker\ncategories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as\nthe next SP.\nTake care and have a good week.\nKyle\nBy the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, at\nleast it is number one in my book.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.",

This will be very short, only 20 minutes (an agenda \nwill soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on \nSaturday).  Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy \nPhillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday \nmorning.  \nAttached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to \nFrevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.  Please do not hesitate to change the \nlist and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of \nEGM for the Enron board.  After this meeting, I will take each of your \npresentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM \nas a business unit.  Also please add some of your other specific goals that \nillustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive \nposition and/or market share.  For example, to be the largest marketer of \ncoal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or \nwhat ever is appropriate.\nAlso attached, for your information, is a recent  presentation from the coal \ngroup.  We thought that this was an excellent format and review.  In the \nupcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as \nwell.  I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and \nformat.\nThanks,\nMike\n                    ",

However it owes much to one off \neffects from tax cuts which boosted consumption. The other elements of the \nGDP have remained quite weak. If consumption falters next quarter (as we \nexpect) GDP growth could end up being much lower. Hence we remain very \ncautious on the medium term.\nFrench GDP accelerated in Q3 at +0.5% qoq. Part of this good news is \nhowever due to the fact that Q2 was revised down (+0.2%qoq instead of \n+0.3%).\n* Household consumption is the reason for the good number, it was up 1.2% \nqoq (after +0.3% in Q2) and contributed to 0.7% to GDP growth. This good \nperformance is essentially the result of one off tax cuts, notably the \nemployment premium paid at the beginning of September. These effects should \nvanish away in Q4 and the preliminary information available for October \nretail sales indeed support this view.\n* Other elements of final domestic demand are much more modest. Investment \nremained virtually flat with a mere +0.1% qoq increase. We expected a \ncontraction hence the resilience of investment is a small positive for us. \nHowever, investment should remain in the doldrums as long as \nindustrialists' prospects are as low as currently.\n* Stocks contributed negatively (-0.4% qoq) to growth. This is not really a \nsurprise given the surge in consumption. But this is a positive element for \nnext quarter, stocks are likely to be back up.\n* Both exports and imports plummeted again reflecting the deterioration of \ninternational trade. Exports were down 1.5% qoq (like in Q2) while imports \nfell 1.5% qoq as well (after -1.0% in Q2). Overall, the contribution from \nnet trade was thus flat, in line with our expectations. But this could go \ninto negative territory as foreign demand will continue to weaken.\nSt?phane D?o\nEconomic Research\nUBS Warburg\nTel : +33 1 48 88 30 36\nFax : +33 1 47 63 48 08\nMob : +33 6 76 85 33 18\nStephane.deo@ubsw.com",

I believe \nthat it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across \nnon-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) \ngiven opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long \nbeen that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) \nin the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of \nbankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting \n(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing \nthe fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the \nlikelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser \nentity, netting almost certainly will not work.\nHas Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form \nof governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, \nbut should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we \nwill find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.\nRisk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type \nanalysis may not yield such reliable results.   \nRod\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  Ngo, Tracy  \nSent: 24 May 2001 22:15\nTo: Nelson, Roderick\nCc: St Clair, Carol; Shackleton, Sara; Pitt, Michael; Boyd, Justin; Evans, \nMark; Wolfe, Greg\nSubject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps\nImportance: High\nRod,\nEnron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum \n& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system \nthat MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I \nneed clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & \nChemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is \nthere a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm \nmonthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the \nliquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.\nGiven Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of \nsetting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser \nis looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to \ntap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.\nIn summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:\n? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc\n? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how \nquickly this out-of-the-money position can move\n? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or \nMaster ISDA)\n? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a \nNetting Agreement for UK and US financial\nCan you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and \nPortland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a \nNetting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and \nEnron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your \nthoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points \naddressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the \ndrafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton \nabout the concept as well.\nPlease let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in \nsetting up a conference call to push this forward.\nThanks,\nTracy",

I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. \n4)  And any other ideas you have.\nIn addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    \nRegards\nJohn",

I\nhave been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my\nthoughtlessness in not having written before. I\nwill bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,\nplease sit down.\nYOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.\nOKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. The\nskull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of\nthe window of my dormitory when it caught\nfire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I\nonly get those sick headaches once a day.\nFortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump were\nwitnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,\nand he was the one who called the fire department\nand the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,\nsince I had nowhere to live because of the burned out\ndormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share\nhis apartment with him. It's really a basement room, but\nit's kind of cute.\nHe is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and\nare planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date\nyet, but it will be before my pregnancy\nbegins to show.\nYes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are\nlooking forward to being grandparents and I know you will\nwelcome the baby and give it the love,\ndevotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.\nThe reason for the delay in our marriage is that my\nboyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us from\npassing our pre-marital blood tests, and I\ncarelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up with\nthe penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you will\nwelcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,\nalthough not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is\nof a different race and religion than ours, I know your\noften-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered\nby the fact that his skin color is somewhat different from\nours. I am sure you will love him as I do.\nHis family background is good too, for I am told that his\nfather is an important gun-bearer in the village from which\nhe came.\nNow that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you\nthat there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a\nconcussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I\nam not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis\nand there is no man in my life.\nHowever, I am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science\nand I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.\nYours,\nYour Loving Daughter.",

Chief Financial Officer Terry Lisenby \nurged. \nTerrence D. Straub, vice president, government affairs, USX-US Steel Group, \nsaid that the industry needs a sustained period of import stability to \nrecover from damage and to address structural issues. \"The restraints [which \ncould be imposed under Section 201] should reduce finished steel imports \nacross the board from non-[North American Free Trade Agreement] countries to \npre-crisis levels, and they should remain in force until the fundamental \nstructural problems have been successfully addressed,\" he said. The \nrestraints must not replace relief under the antidumping and countervailing \nduty laws, he said. \nSection 201, known as the safeguard statute, allows the president to \ntemporarily restrict imports of an investigated product if the International \nTrade Commission finds that surging imports are a substantial cause of \nserious injury to the U.S. industry. U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. \nZoellick has said that the Bush administration is seriously considering a \nSection 201 investigation in steel . \nThe U.S. steel industry was broadsided by an unprecedented import surge in \n1998. Imports dropped in 1999 but began rising again in 2000. \nGeorge Becker, former president of the United Steel Workers of America, \ncalled for immediate passage of H.R. 808-a bill that would roll back steel \nimports for five years. If immediate relief is not provided to the steel \nindustry, \"there will simply be no more steel industry,\" he said. \nRep. Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.), vice chairman of the caucus and a key sponsor \nof H.R. 808, announced that the measure had garnered over 100 cosponsors. \nH.R. 808 would also enhance the Steel Loan Guarantee program by providing \ncash strapped steel firms with loans. \nWhile expressing support for other provisions of H.R. 808, Nucor's Lisenby \nsaid that inefficient mills should be allowed to go out of production. Nucor \nopposes any bail out of legacy costs of these firms or any other type of \nsubsidies, he said. \nWitnesses agreed that world steel overcapacity was a major problem for the \nindustry. Specialty Steel Industry of North America Chairman H.L. Kephart \nwarned that foreign steel producers are planning to add 7.4 million tons of \nnew production capacity in the next five years. \"This is three times the \ntotal annual U.S. consumption of stainless steel coming online by 2005,\" he \nsaid. Since most of this new production cannot be absorbed by foreign \nmarkets, the United States will be targeted for large increases in stainless \nsteel imports, he said. \nBy Rossella Brevetti\nCopyright , 2001 by The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., Washington D.C.",

With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:\n1.  We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)\nare planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2001 (late Feb.\nor early March) to discuss four topics:  Risk management, Deregulation,\nReal options, and International/globalization.\n2.  The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.\nevening, then continue all day Fri.\n3.  I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,\nstructure, participation and content.\n4.  Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,\nin today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling to\nbe the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.\nII.  With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UT\npartcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.\nanalysts and associates.

But \nGolden Staters from Gov. Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma \nresident. He might be the man who saves our future. \nBailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary caps \non the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall \n2002, when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might \nreturn to the West's energy market. \nHis rationale is this: To save California's private electricity market, new \npower plants are desperately needed. But not enough of those plants will be \nbuilt if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product they \nalready are providing. \nCalifornians, though, don't want to promise payment without knowing they will \nbe able to afford the bill. Short-term caps on profits, Bailey believes, are \nthe best way to ease the state's fears, get everybody paid and move on to a \nsystem that works -- for suppliers and customers. \n\"One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create something \nthat California can look at and say, 'So long as prices are determined on \nthis basis, we're prepared to pay,' \" Bailey said in an interview. \"This is a \nmechanism that lets the state say, 'We're not signing a blank check. We don't \nknow what the price is going to be, but we do know how it will be \ndetermined.' \" \nBailey's proposal is different from the limited price caps approved last week \nby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and far better for California. \nThe federal caps would come with all sorts of strings attached, would kick in \nonly during emergencies and would be focused on prices, not profits. Bailey \nis proposing that all power sold from now through summer 2002 be priced at \nthe cost of producing it, plus a profit of 15 percent. That's more than a \nregulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek, and \nfar less than electricity providers have been earning of late. \nCynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has \nsqueezed all it can from California. The firm reported last week that profits \ndoubled in the first quarter of 2001 over a year ago, with pretax income from \nits energy services nearly tripling, to $600 million. Much of the 4,000 \nmegawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already \ncommitted in long-term contracts -- so Bailey has relatively little to lose \nif what remains can only be sold at controlled prices. \nBut here is at least one measure of Bailey's sincerity: His company still is \nowed $252 million for electricity it has provided California. And he's not \ninsisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect, \nor even as part of the deal. \n\"Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with,\" he said. \"Whether that \nultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the \nparties, it will sort itself out one way or another. Perhaps if we find \nprices that work going forward, that could be used as a framework.\" \nBailey, an engineer by training, says no one should mistake his proposal for \na lack of confidence in free markets. He still firmly believes that a \nderegulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the \nWest in the long term. He just wants to make sure there is a long term. \nBailey is watching, and listening, to California. He hears talk of seizing \npower plants, of turning to a public power system. He describes these ideas \nas Draconian and says they would not solve the problem. But he also knows \nthere is a limit to what Californians -- and their elected leaders -- can \ntake. \n\"I recognize we live in a democracy, and lots of things could happen,\" he \nsaid. \nWhat he is proposing, in effect, is a safety valve. He wants to limit the \nmarket in order to save it. \n\"This is an extraordinary situation,\" Bailey said. \"We need to help create \nsome breathing room. ... We all have to work together, and this is the right \nthing to do.\" \nBailey's proposal, made at a conference of energy producers and traders in \nOklahoma last week, was almost lost amid all the focus on the price caps \napproved in Washington. But there is still time to give the idea the \nattention it deserves. Properly nourished, it could be the breakthrough that \nsolves this crisis. Davis and others in California should seize the moment. \nSue Mara\nEnron Corp.\nTel: (415) 782-7802\nFax:(415) 782-7854",

The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. \nUnder the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. \nFurther terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. \nMEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" \nRegent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" \nThe producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. \nRecently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Some of us have briefly discussed the types of comments we may want to submit on behalf of Enron, and the attached list of \"Talking Points\" are issues that Christi and I put together for Rick during his Washington meetings last week.  These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  We will use the talking points as an outline on issues to raise in our comments.  \nWe also want to state up front in the comments that FERC is on the right track and that FERC has done a lot of analysis and studies to determine that \"right sized\" RTOs are in the public interest (this is in response to the negative comments made by the state commissioners that FERC is taking action that has not been proven to be beneficial to consumers).  We also want to make the point that RTO creation is not about retail access and does not impact whether or not a state offers retail choice.\nAlso attached is a link to FERC Staff's notes from RTO Week.  I have not reviewed these notes yet, but we may also want to respond to these notes in our comments using the same criteria as above; i.e., on areas where we feel that the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  \nPlease review the Talking Points paper and the Staff Notes, and let me know what you think about this strategy.  I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input.  \nI hope to keep these comments limited (10 pages or so), so we need to stay focused -- raise the issue, make our point, and move on.  \nThanks Everyone\nSarah\n << File: Talking Points from RTO Week.doc >> \n http://www.ferc.gov/Electric/RTO/workshops/staffsummary.pdf  ",

Energy prices should be an accurate \nindication of the costs imposed on the system.  For example, the average cost \nof 1 kW @ 100% load factor is much different than 1 kW used at 30% load \nfactor, all on-peak, and much different than 1 kW used at 70% load factor, \nall off-peak.  In practice, each customer class has a mixture of customers \nleaning toward each of these extreme.  True equity requires that customers \nwith similar load patterns pay non-disparate energy prices, regardless of \nwhich class the customer is in.   A more proper statement of this goal is:  \nreduce the disparity between prices paid for energy and costs imposed on the \nsystem across all customer classes.  \nTier rates to promote conservation:  Enron suggests a restatement of this \ngoal. Traditionally, the California Commission has favored rate designs that \nreflect marginal costs.  Marginal cost pricing, in and of itself promotes \nefficient use of energy because of the many reasons the CPUC itself has cited \nover the years.  In the situation at hand,  the indicators of marginal cost \nin the wholesale power market are CDWR's purchase cost in hours when the CDWR \nis covering the net short, and the hourly wholesale spot market price (the \nwholesale on-peak forward curve, as a proxy)  in hours when the CDWR is not \nfilling the net short.  Conservation will be incented with use of price \nsignals that reflect market conditions.  A more proper statement of this goal \nis:  To provide customers with the motivation to respond appropriately, \ndesign marginal rates within the rate classes to reflect marginal wholesale \ncosts.\nRegarding these goals, it will take time for the commission and parties to do \nthis - which plays to EES URM and the idea of keeping the 3 cents as an \ninterim rate design while a 6 month rate design case can take place.  I think \nit is inconceivable, however, that the CPUC does not have strong price \nsignals in place for this summer.  So I think we use the \"equal percent of \nmarginal costs\" idea to get price signals in place, but much flatter ones \nthan in the ACR.  (for a variety of reasons, I don't think the 2-part real \ntime pricing being pushed by Mr. Stoness can fly without some radical \nmodifications, but let's talk).\nAbout the residential increase, we may want to weigh in on whether \nresidentail usage above 130% of baseline gets the full brunt of the total \nresidential increase or just 3 cents.  Let's talk about the politics.\nWe also will want to say 1) DA is exempt from the increase  2) any increase \nprior to the effective date of the new rate design should be 3 cents across \nthe board.",

EPMI (acting as EES's scheduling coordinator, or SC) \nwould be paid the ISO decremental  (dec) price for that power.  EPMI would \npass that revenue (along with the cost of supplying that power) onto EES.  \nIf the blackout continued for some time (i.e., days), presumably EES would \nadjust its preschedule and there would be no net sales into the ISO.\nWhether the retail customer gets a payment for being curtailed depends \ncompletely on the contract between EES and the customer.  Presumably the \nforce majure provisions of the contract would protect EES from utility \nblackouts.\nAlan Comnes",

Here is the email from La Joie du Vin concerning other wine \nappreciation groups.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT on 04/17/2000 10:59 \nAM ---------------------------\n\"Greg Giordano\" <giordano@wt.net> on 03/14/2000 07:20:39 AM\nTo: greg_giordano@gensler.com\ncc:  (bcc: Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT)\nSubject: Another Local Wine Appreciation Group\nSince our last email described the closing of La Joie du Vin, we have been\nasked a number of times about the existence of any other, similar groups\ndedicated to enjoying and learning about wine.  The Wine Society of Texas is\njust such a group.  They have extended an invitation to our members and\nfriends to learn about their organization and participate, either as guests\nat events or in an organizational capacity.  We encourage you to take a\nmoment to read to following introduction and consider supporting and\nparticipating in The Wine Society of Texas.  Their mission and goals are\nadmirable and we all, as wine lovers, will benefit as those goals are\nrealized.\nSincerely,\nGreg Giordano\nFrom  Dr. R.D. Kane, Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President, Wine Society\nof Texas\nGreg,\nPer our telephone conversation today, I would like to forward this\n message to you and the members in your organization. As we\n discussed, the Wine Society of Texas is a statewide 501(c)3\n educational organization with approximately 350 members in Texas\n and about 120 in Houston. We also have chapters in Austin, San\n Antonio and two in the DFW area. Our mission statement\n (paraphrased and shortened) is to help develop a wine educated\n consummer base in Texas and to support charitable organizations\n and responsible consumption. Unfortunately, some people confuse\n this message with only working with or interest in Texas wines. But,\n this is far from the truth.\n The WST has been working to provide education on wine tasting,\n wine making and grape growing in a pleasant social setting. The link\n to the local wine industry has been a great asset that has helped\n provide first hand experiences in grape growing and wine making.\n Personally, I have picked and crushed and this has given me have a\n much better appreciation for this part of the process everytime I\n down a glass of wine. However, we have also been trying develop an\n awareness in Texas regarding the benchmarks in fine wines, so that\n consummers increase their knowledge of fine wines from around the\n world.\n This latter point is one that is illustrated in our upcoming event,\n Springfest 2000, on March 24-26. The festival event will be held in\n Old Town Spring Texas and the premium events (Vintner Dinner and\n Grand Tasting) will be held at the Hotel Sofitel near Bush IAH.  We\n will have specialists in grape growing and wine making talking about\n new varietals in Texas, some of which have their \"roots\" in other\n similar regions of the world such as those from Rhone, Spain and\n Italy. We also the Art Institute Culinary School their to give wine and\n food preparation demos. Our Vintner Dinner (Fri. 3/24) will feature a\n special pairing of wines from Texas and France featuring\n Chardonnay and Rhone Blends.  At the Grand Tasting and Media\n Choice Awards Presentations, (Sat. 3/25) the attendees will be\n tasting the best of the wine submitted for judging and vote for their\n favorites. Springfest is a charity event that is raising funds for the\n American Heart Assocition, the Old Town Spring Preservation\n League and the Wine Society of Texas Scholarship Fund. More\n details are available at:\n http://www.winesocietyoftexas.org/houston/\nI welcome you and your members to\n check out the WST and Springest 2000. If you have any questions,\nor would like more information, please contact me.\nRegards,\nDr. R.D. Kane\nCo-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President\nWine Society of Texas\nSee our new website at:\nhttp://winesocietyoftexas.org",

I have been wondering about other wine appreciation groups since the closing of La Joie du Vin. I will definitely check out the Wine Society of Texas and consider supporting and participating in their events. It sounds like a great organization with admirable goals.

In other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we put it at Enron.  How we put the physical gas nominations and power scheduling at the desks.  How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net Works.\nSecond, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is straightforward)?\nThird, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other parts.  In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, etc.  All the linkages.\nFourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies as well.\nFifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model.\nSixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's meeting).\nFinally, how we originate these deals and charge for our service.\nI know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time schedules, but I would like to get it all pulled together soon in the following format:\nA draft of a contract between EWS and ProcessCo (or Net Works).  Also, a clear picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity.  Also, a recommendation on how Enron maintains its risk reporting and general ledger as well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in Enron and how those functions work with ProcessCo.\nSheri Thomas, Jeff Harbert, Frank Davis, Fred Philipson, and Andrea Crump are now full time reporting to Tom on commercialization, all have mid/back office experience and can help Beth and Sally with alot of this work before Tom comes back from his cruise at the end of next week.\nLet's discuss Monday.\nThanks.\nGP",

In the 2 weeks that I worked with you on ConEd, I did not realise that I offended you in any way, personally or professionally. I have also had similar negative feedback from Jason Woodward, and I have never met or worked with him. \nBefore your group assumed the new market role for EES, I worked very closely with Peter Vint, Robert Gresch, Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues. \nWe worked as a team, and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up, we all pitched in to resolve the issues. Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues, and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking. I have tried to respect that.\nPrior to sending out the IL analysis, I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis, and had some questions. I did not get a call back. Taking the time to return that call, may have saved us all some uneccessary stress. Well, good things do sometimes come from bad situations. The good thing is that we have all seen the need for a closer approach to new market entry issues.

The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)\nThe overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  \n\t   \nThe Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. \nAlthough laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  \nWhether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.\nYour continued support is greatly appreciated.

Energy prices should be an accurate \nindication of the costs imposed on the system.  For example, the average cost \nof 1 kW @ 100% load factor is much different than 1 kW used at 30% load \nfactor, all on-peak, and much different than 1 kW used at 70% load factor, \nall off-peak.  In practice, each customer class has a mixture of customers \nleaning toward each of these extreme.  True equity requires that customers \nwith similar load patterns pay non-disparate energy prices, regardless of \nwhich class the customer is in.   A more proper statement of this goal is:  \nreduce the disparity between prices paid for energy and costs imposed on the \nsystem across all customer classes.  \nTier rates to promote conservation:  Enron suggests a restatement of this \ngoal. Traditionally, the California Commission has favored rate designs that \nreflect marginal costs.  Marginal cost pricing, in and of itself promotes \nefficient use of energy because of the many reasons the CPUC itself has cited \nover the years.  In the situation at hand,  the indicators of marginal cost \nin the wholesale power market are CDWR's purchase cost in hours when the CDWR \nis covering the net short, and the hourly wholesale spot market price (the \nwholesale on-peak forward curve, as a proxy)  in hours when the CDWR is not \nfilling the net short.  Conservation will be incented with use of price \nsignals that reflect market conditions.  A more proper statement of this goal \nis:  To provide customers with the motivation to respond appropriately, \ndesign marginal rates within the rate classes to reflect marginal wholesale \ncosts.\nRegarding these goals, it will take time for the commission and parties to do \nthis - which plays to EES URM and the idea of keeping the 3 cents as an \ninterim rate design while a 6 month rate design case can take place.  I think \nit is inconceivable, however, that the CPUC does not have strong price \nsignals in place for this summer.  So I think we use the \"equal percent of \nmarginal costs\" idea to get price signals in place, but much flatter ones \nthan in the ACR.  (for a variety of reasons, I don't think the 2-part real \ntime pricing being pushed by Mr. Stoness can fly without some radical \nmodifications, but let's talk).\nAbout the residential increase, we may want to weigh in on whether \nresidentail usage above 130% of baseline gets the full brunt of the total \nresidential increase or just 3 cents.  Let's talk about the politics.\nWe also will want to say 1) DA is exempt from the increase  2) any increase \nprior to the effective date of the new rate design should be 3 cents across \nthe board.",

The \nsenior White & Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms \nor retired.\nHighlights: \n--Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their \ndescription in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo's \ndescription of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate \nwith Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag \nor Klockner were \"obligated\" to purchase NSM's steel.? Izower's counsel \nobjected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? \n--Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements \nand asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the \"underwriting group.\"? \nIzower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher \nNatwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility \nschedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion \ndates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in \nthe drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and \nPaine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.\n--Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence \nof certain material agreements such as: \na)????? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and \nChamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they \nreceived an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;\nb)????? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to \nwhich NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had \nan ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from \nthe Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and \ntake over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM's ability to import and export \nmaterials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing \nfashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in \nthe offering memo as it may not have qualified as \"related party transaction.\"\n--Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM \ndeal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.\nThis e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential \ninformation.

Let me know if you need any help on this.\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  Sherrick, Jeffrey  \nSent: Tuesday, March 20, 2001 4:40 PM\nTo: Aronowitz, Alan; Wallace, Stephen; Walls, Rob\nCc: Carolan, Dominic; Chatham, Gerry\nSubject: Carolan redeployment to LNG group\nI am very pleased that Dominic has been offered an opportunity to re-deploy \nfrom EGEP to the LNG legal group upon the completion of his current \nassignment in the disposition of Enron's China E&P assets.  As you know, we \nhave been going through the data-room process and we will be calling for \nfinal bids on April 9th.  Dominic is finalizing the draft PSA and associated \nbidding documents at this time.  We plan to distribute a copy of such to all \npotential bidders by the end of the week.\nAt this time we have 15 companies that have signed the CA and are at various \nstages in the evaluation process.  We believe we have 7-8 serious bidders and \nwe hope to get at least 3-4 bids submitted on the 9th.  To complicate the \nprocess a little, we have 3 majors seriously evaluating both the E&P \nproperties and the old EI China pipeline project.  We are coordinating with \nChris Hunt, Bill Krenz and Keith Stepp on the integrated sale of both assets \nwith this select group of companies.  In addition to the  current drafting \nwork, we will have a few additional data-room visitors prior to the 9th, due \ndiligence requests and, of course, definitive agreement negotiations to \nconclude before the process is complete.\nThe reason I outlined the above is to give all concerned parties a feel for \nthe process we need Dominic to participate in (to varying degrees) until it \nis concluded.  There will be times where this project will require 100% of \nhis time for several days and then other times where there will be a few days \nwith no pressing issues.  However, to avoid any confusion over the next \ncouple of months I thought it would be a good idea to lay out a few ground \nrules for Dominic's time.\n1) EGEP supports Dominic re-deploying to the LNG group and will strive to get \nhim 100% transferred as soon as practical.\n2) During the next couple of months Dominic will have some \"dead time\" in the \nChina disposition and during this time we are supportive of Dominic spending \ntime with the LNG group, getting up to speed with the activities in the group \nand taking on low-priority assignments that could be delayed if his time was \nneeded in the sale process.\n3) The only assignment Dominic has to complete with EGEP is the sale of the \nChina assets.  There will be no future assignments.\n4) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his \nprimary responsibility will be the China sale and this activity will take \nprecedence over any other assignments.\n5) Until EGEP senior management releases Dominic to the LNG group, his \nprimary office will remain in 3 Allen Center with EGEP.  He is expected to \nreport to 3 Allen Center and the daily 8:30 am disposition meeting to \nascertain any sale related needs for his time.  This meeting usually lasts \nfor 30-45 minutes and if there are no issues he can report to the LNG group.\nIn some ways I know this appears to be a little silly.  However, I also know \nthat if we don't set out a few rules we will encounter a problem and it is \nnot fair to Dominic or in Enron's best interest to let Dominic take on two \n\"A-priority\" projects at this time.  We need his services to successfully \nsell this project. Unfortunately, we can not schedule when certain activities \nwill be needed, but we will be reasonable whenever possible to allow for a \nsmooth effort in both groups.  During the next couple of months I'm sure \nDominic will be a very positive addition to your staff in spite of the time \nallocated to the China sale effort.  He has been a very productive and \nvaluable employee for our group and I am very glad Enron found a way to \nretain his services.\nIf you have any questions please give me a call.  Thanks for your support \nduring this short-term need in our group.  We will try to make this \ninconvenience as small as possible.\njeff ",

The FERC has made it\nclear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to \nISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to \nlift the price caps.\nOn Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July \n10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (\"MS\").  As you may \nrecall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price \nauthority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS \nsought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by \nFERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\"\nAs a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order \napproving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority \nthrough 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price was \nnot a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO \nwas willing to pay.\"  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the \nprice cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California Power \nExchange or bilateral markets.\"\nFERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered \nthe caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted by \nlaw, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators \nto bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\"\nThe MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, \n\"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\"  MS also requested \nan emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the \nprice cap reduction.\nFERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum \npurchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not \napproving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price \nthey want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to \npay.  \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot \ndictate their price.\"\nImportantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less ability \nto procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if \nthe ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced \npurchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they \nchoose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to \nmeet its needs.\"  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an \nincrease in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to \na maximum purchase price.\nAlso, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid \ntheir capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC \nstates clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 \nOrder and the ISO tariff.\"  [Emphasis added]\nFERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a \nmaximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market \nrules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to \nISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, \"and could not be \nimplemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 \nOrder was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate \nsupply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase \nprice.\"\nISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be \naccompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper \nresponse to low supplies in the ISO markets.\"\nConcurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests \nthat the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk \nmanagement tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing \nreal time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new \ngeneration and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the \nprevious November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, the \nCommission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of \nrecognizing that we have a role.\"  He then reiterates his preference for \nremoving all price caps.  He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom of \nthe problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our \napproval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports \nsuch a move.\"  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, \nstating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a \nreturn to 'command and control.' \"  Hebert states that, \"The independence of \nthe ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to \nquote the resignation letter.\"  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 \nproceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power \nmarkets, \"including the California markets.\"\nThis decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's \nmeeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that \nprice.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing \nefforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.\nPlease call if you have any questions.\nDan",

They are working on an agreement with \nCPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to \nsupport the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have \npriority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a \ncash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.

And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\nThe New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.

Many more than we can possibly handle.  We need the help of caring and dedicated people who would like to enter a new high paying prestigious profession. \nThe court has decided how much these parents are to receive but the caseloads are so large that the results are that there is over  $32 Billion dollars worth of uncollected Child Support in the US today   and this amount grows by millions every week.  \nIf you would be interested in helping us, then  we have all of the training that you will need to start a new business in this high growth profession of \"Child Support Processing!\"   \nWe have the resources available to you to help you track down deadbeat parents and force them to pay what they legally owe, without ever having to come into contact with them! \n We have the most extensive Computer Data Bases in the world for the processing of Child Support.   Our databases allow you to track down dead beats, find their assets and then collect the child support, which is due.  These powerful databases will be available to you if you choose to join us.\n  You can do what private investigators do, legally, and for a fraction of what it would normally cost! And you can do it from the comfort of your own home office!  \nMore details about our Child Support Collection Course:\n  Child Support Collection has reached epidemic proportions, $32 billion nationally  ; state agencies are simply too understaffed!  State agencies are typically very happy when we assist a parent.  We find the dead beat and their assets and the state agencies are pleased to use their government powers, working with us, to collect the back child support. \n Our Child Support Collection course teaches you to how locate the DEAD-BEAT parent, their assets, employment, bank accounts and how to collect on those assets.  \nThe manual supplies the forms, brochures, and child support business methodology. \nWe also have the most powerful reporting capabilities at your disposal to help you track down dead-beat parents. \n Unpaid child support is an epidemic . . . and you can be the cure!  \nAs our national and local media remind us every day, millions of custodial parents are struggling to raise their families without the child support to which they are entitled. In fact, you or someone you know is probably tackling this problem right now. \n This Child Support Collection Course teaches you to recover your own child support payments. Or you can learn to help others in need, earning about 25% to 30% of what is collected.  That translates to $4,000 . . . $8,000 . . .even $12,000 earned each month collecting for others! You'd be hard-pressed to come up with any other legal business opportunity that allows you to earn such a significant income while performing such a valuable community service.  \nNot only do you have the potential to make thousands of dollars a month recovering delinquent child support payments, you'll also \"earn\" the gratitude of custodial parents and their children who are finally receiving the money they're due! \nYou might be thinking a successful child support recovery business would require a difficult time commitment or a lot of expensive equipment. Not at all! You can make thousands of dollars each month, part-time or full-time, working from your home, with only a telephone and a home computer! \nThis course places you at the leading edge of a major national trend, namely, privatizing the recovery of delinquent child support payments. Whereas the government succeeds only one fifth of the time in this area, well-trained private parties are doing four times better! \nAnd remember every time you recover a payment, you can earn 25% to 30% of what you find! \n We provide step by step instructions for you to follow, enabling you to collect all back-owed child support for yourself or anyone else you choose. It is not necessary to have in-depth legal knowledge or even a college education.  \nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, absent parents in the United States have a big bill to pay: $32 billion in delinquent child support payments. That is over 15 million cases, with 1.5 million new cases added every year. More than half of court-ordered child support cases become delinquent at some time, and in more than one fourth of cases, no payments are ever made. \nChildren deserve and need the support they have been awarded, but government agencies aren't offering any real help because they are totally over whelmed. In fact, the agencies are so flooded with requests that they only collect about 18% of the child support money they go after. In other words, the government typically has an 82% failure rate! No private business could survive with that kind of record, and the impact on children can be devastating. \nStatistics show that after a divorce, an absent parent's available income goes up 43%, while the custodial parent's spending money goes down 20%. \n With your help, children in need have a four-times-greater chance of receiving the money they are due than if they relied on the government for recovery.  \nOne mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent parent \"is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration and futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and authorities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case.\" But this same mother's outlook changed  after reviewing our course: \"I would have given anything to have this knowledge years ago. This is the best $249.00 I have ever spent.\"  \n We have Customer -Support staff available to you from \n8:00AM to 9:00PM(Mountain Time) 6 days a week. \nIf you call this number, you can talk to one of our very experienced \nCustomer Support personnel.

Today the ISO couldn't get supply \nfrom the market and informed market participants that CDWR would sleeve deals \nto the ISO. This occurred at a time when CA was in Stage 3 emergency (only \nthe second one ever) and anticipating rolling blackouts this evening. Enron \nand other suppliers began to aggregate supply to sell to CDWR presumably to \ngo to the ISO.  Belden was concerned that Gray Davis may just withhold \npayment through CDWR when settlements are due. This concern prompted us to \nrequire paper confirms for hourly deals and a discussion between Christian \nYoder and Steve Hall (Stoel Rives) with the assistant director at CDWR to \nmake sure CDWR management was on board - which they confirmed verbally. \nRegardless of all of this we still have some paranoia about getting paid. Is \nGray Davis willing to confirm that no payment issue through CDWR will occur? \nWe are currently continuing to aggregate supply through the day but are \nhesitant to increase quantities without such assurance. Other suppliers \nappeared hesitant as well as they wouldn't sleeve the deals to CDWR.",

If we didn't accept, then they \nwanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area.  \n My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take \nvolumes if they were nominated before 9:00.

Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a\nNomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available\non the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS\nto deliver those additional volumes.\nIf you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined\nabove, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of\nthis letter provided for that purpose.\n------\nBruce Kohrs\nPhone: (403)205-7684\nFax: (403)266-1947\ne-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com",

I agree with your understanding of the deal, and I do not think that the new language will work in the way they think it will. As you mentioned, we were only obligated to take volumes if they were nominated before 9:00, and I do not think we should agree to their proposed changes. Let's discuss this further.\n\nBest,\nGrant"

Flying made her nervous, so she\nalways took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.\nOne time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her\nBible, he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After\nawhile, he turned to her and asked, \"You don't really believe all that stuf=\nf\nin there do you?\"\nThe lady replied, \"Of course I do. It is the Bible.\"\nHe said, \"Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?\"\nShe replied, \"Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible.\"\nHe asked, \"Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the\nwhale?\"\nThe lady said, \"Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I\nwill ask him.\"\n\"What if he isn't in heaven?\" the man asked sarcastically.\n\"Then you can ask him.\" replied the lady.\n=02=05---------------------------------------------------------------------=\n--------\n------------------------\nTexas Wisdom!\n1.Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.\n2.

George W.  Bush. The candidates have agreed on these rules: I will ask\na question.  The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed\nremarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters.  The opponent will\nthen have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into\nvoting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly\nwhile he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more\nminutes.\nLet's start with the vice president.  Mr.  Gore, can you give us the name of\na downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that\nstrains the bounds of common sense?\nGore:\nAs I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we\nhave so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage, the\ndowntrodden have a clear choice in this election.  My opponent wants to cut\ntaxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  I, on the other hand, want to\nput the richest 1 percent in an ironclad lockbox so they can't\nhurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight.  Mrs.\nFrampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for\ngas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me.\nAlso, her poodle has arthritis.\nLehrer:\nGov.  Bush, your rebuttal.\nBush:\nGovernors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying with\nthem, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I want to\nempower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my opponent,\nwhose mother is not Barbara Bush.\nLehrer:\nLet's turn to foreign affairs.  Gov.  Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic were to\nlaunch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able to\npronounce his name?\nBush:\nThe current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and\ndidn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about that\nguy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies.  And then Dick would present\nme several options for dealing with that guy.  And then Dick would tell me\nwhich one to choose.  You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough\nforeign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New\nMexico.\nLehrer:\nMr.  Gore, your rebuttal.\nGore:\nForeign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in. I\nserved my country in Vietnam.  I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas\nin World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And when\nthat war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way\nthat any undecided woman\nvoter would find romantic.\nIf I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal\nknowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an\nironclad lockbox.  Because the American people deserve a president who can\ncomfort them with simple metaphors.\nLehrer:\nVice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security system?\nGore: It's a vital issue, Jim.  That's why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed\nchanging the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to every senior\ncitizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the\nyear 2250.  In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the  next 10\nyears to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to\ntheir homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with\nthe child-proof cap.\nLehrer:\nGov.  Bush?\nBush:\nThat's fuzzy math.  I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to do\nmath every day.  I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm going\nto fill potholes out on Rt.  36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof\nthe sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.\nLehrer:\nIt's time for closing statements.\nGore:\nI'm my own man.  I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will\nfight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the\nWhite House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.\nBush:\nIt's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but\nRepublicans.\nLehrer:\nGood night.\nThe information contained in this e-mail message is intended only for the \npersonal and confidential use of the recipient(s) named above.

Much of this concern comes from incremental reliability\nrequirements being developed by ECAR and NERC, along with potentially\nsubstantial fines for failure to comply.  In order for Wabash Valley to\nobtain Network Transmission service we must have firm resources that can be\nqualified as designated network resources.\nWe received a document from a control-area operator that defines their\ncriteria for network resources.  These criteria are defined as follows:\n* Network resources do not include any generation that is committed\nfor sale to another party on a firm basis.\n* For a  power purchase to qualify as a network resource it must be\navailable to the purchaser on a non-interruptible basis.  Power purchases\nthat can be interrupted by the seller for reliability reasons qualify as\nnetwork resources.  This includes power sales that are provided with a\ncurtailment priority below that of the seller's native load.  Purchased\npower that can be interrupted by the seller for economic reasons does not\nqualify as a network resource, but purchases that can be interrupted for\nextreme economic penalties other than more economic sale or purchase\nopportunities qualify as network resources.\n* For a power purchase to qualify as a network resource, the purchaser\nmust have an obligation to take the power.  The obligation to purchase does\nnot need to be in the form of a capacity payment.  However, if there is no\ncapacity payment, the contract should include a minimum take obligation.\nThe Commission does not require an around-the-clock purchase obligation; it\nhas approved as a network resource a power purchase with a minimum capacity\nfactor of 80% during on-peak hours and no minimum take in off-peak hours.\nHow much lower a capacity factor the Commission would permit is not clear.\n* The requirement that a network resource be non-interruptible applies\nto the transmission service as well as the power supply itself.  Therefore,\na network customer that designates an off-system resource as a network\nresource must obtain firm transmission service for the generator to the\nsystem of the network transmission provider.  If transmission from the\ngenerator to the network transmission provider is non-firm transmission\nservice, the power purchase does not qualify as a network resource.\nHowever, the requirement of firm transmission service does not apply to any\ngenerator that was serving the load on July 9, 1996, because such generation\nis grandfathered by Order No. 888.\nIt may be that your organization can meet these criteria with documentation\nof resources and transmission path agreements, so as to not require any\nadditional \"firmness\" of the power supply you have already proposed to us.\nPlease take a look, and contact me with any further information you can\nprovide.\nLet me know, also, if you need any else from me.\nAllen McKee\nSystem Planning Principal\nWabash Valley Power Association",

I can't believe you \nare such a rotten \"bik\" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that?\nMy advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, \nwine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be \nliving out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say \nthat sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed \nsense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can \nimagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and \nwent to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think \ncarefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how \nmuch money you actually need to get by. Then add $500/month to that figure, \nand you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm \nonly speaking from Maui experience here. \nIf you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally \nbroke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to \nthe end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind \nof sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd \nfeel SOOOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would \nhave even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back \n- that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live \nwith mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've \ngiven them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. \nThen there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure.\nAnyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're \nmeant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not.\nLove,\nKate",

Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn\nabout all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with\nNo. 2.  He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to\nArnold Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement\nfor NOx and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by\ndoing some major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway,\ndepending upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will\nundoubtably determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40\nppmvd.  Id like your comments asap.\n              1.     The responsible official name change to  Danny\nPribble.\n                         2..  The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions\nto 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of\nstartup        and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that\nthese rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE\n     data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during\nlow-load conditions of 60%and lower.\n           The permit application represented turbine operations at base\n        load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)\n        occurring    no more than 20% of the time.  The potential to emit\n        calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of\n        lb.hr and ton/yr.      These values were accepted by the EPA for\n        the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the EPA\n        (See EPA Statement     of Basis document).  Because the permit\n        conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year\n        values, Transwestern is          concerned that under low load\n        conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of NOx and CO would be\n        40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is       requesting that  a provision be\n        made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held\n        to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of   the time that the turbines\n        operating conditions is less than or equal to 60%.\n        3.      The word \"Catepillar\" is mispelled throughout the permit.\n        4.      Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas\n        requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry\n        technology) that are not         normally used to monitor and\n        measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has received\n        approval from the EPA for other custom     fuel monitoring\n        schedules to use  \"GPA Standard 2377\" (length of stain tube) or gas\n        chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in\n        the natural gas.\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\nmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\nintended recipient (s).

I would like to clarify the differences between the TECO \ndeal and the MDEA deal.  The TECO-Frontera deal consists of EPMI marketing \nthe excess capacity off the Frontera plant.  TECO has some existing sales off \nthat plant which are not incorporated in our profit sharing arrangement \n(\"Existing Transactions\").  Also, we agreed to work with them to sell \n\"Structured Transactions\" off the plant.  The \"Back-to-Back Transactions\" \nrefer to the daily sale of MW off the plant, that EPMI is sleeving for TECO.  \nI understand that we may have opportunities to sell excess generation off \nMDEA's generation assets, however, I don't think the bulk of the contract \nshould focus on this.  There is little mention of the obligation to serve the \nNative Load through 3rd party transactions, which as I understand it, is the \nintent of the MDEA deal.  \n2)  Definitions section:\n Existing Transactions - defined as MDEA having prior obligations to sell \nenergy etc.  - I don't think MDEA has any of these outside of their Native \nLoad.\n Marketing Strategy - This mentions a Trading and Risk policy.  The policy \nused for TECO  mentions that EPMI will provide VAR reports.  This will not be \ndone for    Clarksdale/Yazoo.\n3)  Section 4 - Availability of Products; Metering\n Risk of loss and all price, credit, and unit contingency....      I thought \nwe were bearing credit risk with 3rd parties.\n Further down in the paragraph in parens... (and execute a Confirmation \nevidencing such obligation)...   We need to check with the Deal Clearing \ngroup what they will be   confirming.  Normally, hourly trades do not get \nconfirmed.  I have not yet informed anyone in confirms about this deal \nbecause I was assuming we would not have to provide   confirms to MDEA.  \nPlease let me know if this is not the case.\n4)  Section 8 - Performance Standards\n (b) (1) Availability calculation is using 480 MW, this is the Frontera plant \ncapacity.\n5)  Section 9 - Delivery Point and Title\n What about sales to MDEA from EPMI (this goes back to my statement in #1 \nthat this contract focuses more on the buy side instead of the sale). \n6)  Section 11 - Fuel management services\n I thought we were sleeving the gas, therefore, EPMI will be a party to the \nFuel Related Transactions.\n6)  Section 16 - Payment and Fees\n Existing Transaction Costs are mentioned - These may be irrelevant to this \nsection\n \"Market Proceeds\"  - I think this should more specifically state that this \nis only in relation to the Mwhrs sold off their facilities to a 3rd party.\n MOST IMPORTANTLY - There is no mention of how EPMI will be reimbursed for \nthe power that we purchase on MDEA's behalf.  I expect that this will be most \nof the    settlement activity related to this deal.    \n7)  Exhibit [] REPORTS\n \n 1) Profit & Loss, Risk Statement - This says that we will track the change \nin value of the power output.  We are not going to monitor the forward value \nof their positions.\n 2)  Position Statement - This will not be done at all.  To truly give an \naccurate position statement, we would need to forecast their load for the \nnext two years, and then   economically dispatch the plants to see what their \nnet short position is.  I don't think this is relevant, and per my previous \nconversations with Reagan, we are not doing this.\n In the TECO agreement, we are giving a forward view of the value of the \nplant.  This cannot be done for MDEA because we cannot determine when we are \ndispatching to   serve their load or to sell to a 3rd party.  \nThis is all for now....\nE",

Why Rate Hikes Now?\nCPUC President Lorretta Lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes.  \nDavis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest \nsolution, but that there is a potentially painful political price attached.   \nDavis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system, passing \non most of the hikes to business and industrial users.\nOther California politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes.  The \nCalEnergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors, who are \nnow able to sell outside the state, if they can get similar relief from the \ncourts.  And it's not just the QFs--the giant Reliant Energy is appealing to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco against Federal Judge Frank \nDamrell's series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to \nCalifornia.\n2. What Impact Will the Rate Hikes Have?\nRate rises will stabilize the situation going forward, but there will be a \nmessy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts.  Some form of \nrescheduling is a possibility, but there are any number of accidents that \ncould happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities -- if they don't \nseek protection from creditors themselves.\n3. Undercollection/Net Short Still Unaddressed\nAll of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the \nbond revenue plan.  Still, the passage of rate hikes could speed up the \nlegislature on these fronts as well.  The bulk of the rate hikes will go \nfirst to repay the DWR, then to the commercial creditors.  Absent the \ntransmission line deal, the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured \nto repay the past undercollect.  Long-term power contracts are still \nrelatively meaningless until 2003, when the majority of the contracts kick \nin.\n4. Large Power Suppliers Losing Patience\nRelations are also deteriorating between Davis and the large power \nsuppliers.  Davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them \nduring the drawn out negotiations, talking to several of the main CEOs almost \ndaily.  But state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate \ninvestigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the \ngrowing political heat from themselves.  This is only agitating the larger \ngenerators more as every day passes.  If Reliant loses their case, it may \nalso tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy.  \nWhat's more, financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience, \nand the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy.  PG&E in \nparticular simply will not agree to Davis' transmission lines deal as it \nstands, and a bankruptcy workout may offer the best, albeit uncertain, chance \nof a return to eventual health someday.\n5. QFs Listening and Waiting\nBut the largest threat, as we have been saying, is not from the major energy \ncompanies.  It is the small companies -- known as QFs -- that will be the \ntriggers if bankruptcy occurs.  Remember these two facts: (1) The QFs are a \ndiverse group of 600 companies, and it only takes three of them to force \nbankruptcy; and (2) many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any \npossible standing for future court action.  It is in the interests of a \nnumber of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be \nreached, but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten \nto force bankruptcy.\nOther bullish news: PG&E gets extended forbearance until April 13th from its \nbanks, and SoCal announces that it will pay some QFs.  The actual amount of \npayments to the QFs is still subject to the CPUC  approving a revised pricing \nformula that is satisfactory to the QFs.  That decision should come tomorrow.\n6. Outlook\nLast week we wrote that \"the QFs felt there was no point in filing today \nbecause they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and \nin all likelihood, what they can get from the CPUC hearing next week.\"  The \nnext 48 hours will be crucial.  Only massive rate hikes (40% or higher \nroughly) would address the undercollect issue and Davis is unlikely to \nauthorize those.\nAs one source told us, \"the age of denial is (mostly) coming to an end, and \nthat is the main source of hope that California can begin to move forward \nfrom this.\"  But the situation is so complex, and there are so many players \nand angles involved, that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will \nstill be complicated and vulnerable to failure.",

Gray Davis, is for the state to set a firm ceiling \non what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not \none dime more.\nThe trade-off would be certain blackouts, possibly more than if the state \ncontinues to pay any price electricity sellers demand.\nSome advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number of \nblackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by \nscheduling service interruptions.\n\"We need to stop this game of electricity chicken,\" said Michael Shames, \ndirector of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, which first proposed the \nidea. \"We are likely to see blackouts this summer; we should use them to our \nadvantage rather than be victimized by them.\"\nThe plan calls for creating a \"buyers' cartel\" of California, Oregon and \nWashington. Essentially, the states would decide at what price they were \nwilling to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level.\nThe state has spent $6 billion on energy purchases since January, and at one \npoint during last week's power shortage was spending $1,900 per megawatt hour \n-- more than 10 times what Davis has planned on for this summer. That kind of \nspending cannot go on, Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek \nsaid yesterday.\n\"The question is, can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the \nstate maintain economic stability? I believe the answer is no,\" said Keeley, \nthe lower house's main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that \nput the state in the power-buying business.\n\"To get this problem solved, we have to think in bold terms,\" said Keeley, \nwho introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul \nKoretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel.\nTHREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE\nDavis said last week that \"my bias would be to keep the lights on at any \nprice.\" But yesterday, the governor said a temporary price limit is \n\"certainly a matter we've talked about and considered at some length. The \nnext step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond \nto it.\"\nA spokesman for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being \nconsidered. Calls to the office of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber were not \nreturned.\nThe idea has appeal among some consumers who believe, as many state officials \ndo, that California is being gouged for electricity.\n\"I can see if our bills were $20 or $30 more, but this is ridiculous,\" said \nKimberly Chambers, an 18-year-old fashion design student from Oakland. \n\"Whatever it takes, I don't think we should have to pay for more.\"\nBut Yunah Kim, 36, who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago, said \nblackouts should not even be considered.\n\"The infrastructure of government is coming apart, and it's the basic service \ngovernment is able to provide,\" she said. \"Businesses are not going to put up \nwith that. It's very shortsighted. We just have to pay until there's a \nsolution.\"\nSeverin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute \nin Berkeley, said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits \nbelieve.\n\"I think they (power companies) would call our bluff,\" and sell their \nelectricity elsewhere, Borenstein said. \"I don't think the state has the \nability to credibly commit to paying no more than 'X.' That would be a very \ncontroversial decision.\"\nLegislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into a \nWest Coast buyers cartel. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Dede Alpert, D- \nCoronado, would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy power \nif it is too expensive.\nThe maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such \nthings as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers \nwould be built in, supporters said.\nLOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL\nAlpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts, but that seems unlikely.\n\"Everybody I talked to -- once you establish that there will be blackouts --\nboth businesses and residents say, let's have control,\" Alpert said.\nThe California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned a \nrecent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $21. \n8 billion and 135,000 jobs, is considering whether scheduled interruptions \nwould be less harmful.\n\"The problem if we do (scheduled blackouts) is that we may have an inordinate \namount of blackouts,\" said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the group.\nNO EASY TASK\nThe ISO, which runs the state's power grid, is scheduled to issue a report \ntomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work.\nSen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, said that planning blackouts is not as \neasy as it sounds.\n\"The difficulty is a pragmatic one -- the circuits are not wired to deal with \nchoices like we are having to make,\" said Bowen, who has been holding \nhearings on how the state might better manage blackouts.\n\"Maybe we should be paying people to turn off their fuse box,\" Bowen said.\nChronicle staff writer Marsha Ginsburg contributed to this report. / E-mail \nLynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.\n,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 1",

The reduced\nemissions will be in place as soon as 2003, according to Massachusetts\nGovernor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.\n     The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce\ntheir emissions or face regulatory action by the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection. Cellucci said, \"We challenged these power plants\nto clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the most\ncomprehensive air emissions standards in the United States.\"\n     The agreement -- which the five operators of the six plants agreed\nto with the state -- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.\n     Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreement\nresulted through \"cooperative efforts,\" but added, \"We will pursue new\nregulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure\nthe plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require the\nfinalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities.\"\n     The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next few\nmonths -- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds of\nsulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.\n     The five companies -- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG Energy\nInc., PE&E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,\nand Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC -- have submitted\npreliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide\nemissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulate\nand carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.\n     \"Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmental\nexcellence works in today's competitive market,\" said James McGowan, senior\nvice president of Sithe. \"This is a win-win program that will produce the\nbest power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as a\nwhole.\"\n     The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,\nparticularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPA\nenforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities use\nupgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit charges\nthe utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of the\nClean Air Act.\n     The Massachusetts situation \"does undercut the arguments of\ndirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done,\" said Frank\nO'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.\n     Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the\nutilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, \"that is like\ncomparing apples to oranges.\"\n     Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollution\nmigrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no serious\nproblems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, stricter\ncontrols on utilities operating in that part of the country are\nunnecessary. \"States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and ask\nutilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainment\nproblems in the Northeast, so it makes sense,\" Hemlepp argued.\n     And about EPA's lawsuit, \"What people overlook is that EPA's\nlawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal under\nthe Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done is\nlegal,\" Hemlepp said. ",

Both Enron and Dynegy remain committed to\nthe NWN transaction.  There are no direct implications for the sale as\nNWN, not Enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  The\nstructure of the seller financing has not changed.  \nBruce DeBolt did describe the only indirect impact of Enron's current\nsituation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on Enron's ability\nto transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if Enron's\ncredit rating decays to a given point.  \nThe Enron/Dynegy transaction is expected to close in the 3rd Quarter of\n2002.

I \nunderstand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron \nwill guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several \nadditional, basic questions re:  the terms of the Enron loan and the \nintercreditor arrangements with Peoples. \nIn terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) \nand 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form.\n1.  People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours?\n2.  Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other \nventurer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will \nthey instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if \none venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer \nwill share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)?\n3.  Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is \nto be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each \nventurer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although \nI presume the facilities will be cross defaulted). \n4.  Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the \nPeople's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other \nthan the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC?\n5.  Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory \nprepayments?\n6.  Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be?\n7.  Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee?  What will the commitment \nfee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?)\n8.  Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender \nfacility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement?\n9.  Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be \navailable? \nPlease call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.  I look forward to \nworking with you on this transaction.  \nThanks!\nHeather",

I am \nawaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on \nNYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the \ndetailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position \nin Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of \npursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that \npiece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured \nin the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key \nissues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I \nhave asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, \nPurchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                 \n       I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of \nthe meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et \nal)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall \nif the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide \nHarris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly \nNew York and California) about which the government may have continuing \nconcerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward \nto a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left \nme a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit \nand the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is \nevidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing \nmaterial before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any \nchanges he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken \nLay.

Given the complexities of his schedule, if there is any other way, it would be good.  What do you think?\nRosie\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Jim Kollaer\" <jkollaer@houston.org>@ENRON  \nSent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 3:33 PM\nTo:\tLay, Kenneth\nCc:\tAnne Culver\nSubject:\tSheila and the Trade Promotion Authority\nKen, I am writing to ask Enron's assistance with a pro-Trade Promotion\nAuthority message to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.\nThe position of the Partnership and Enron are well known to Sheila.  She\nconsistently has voiced doubts about her ability to vote for trade\nissues such as China PNTR and fast track/TPA, but in the end joins her\npro-business and trade colleagues in supporting these measures. You have\nalways been a very effective lobbyist on this issue.\nMost recently, on October 10, 2001, Rep. Lee told Rep. Norman Dicks\n(D-WA) (he was the first D to be a supporter of this new compromise leg\n(HR 3005) and is whipping the issue for the Ds) that she is a no vote on\nTPA (HR 3005).\nRep. Lee's reasons for not supporting this issue are as follows:\n1. The process has been too partisan, Ds like Rep. Charles Rangel were\nnot consulted and brought to the table to develop compromise language in\nthe beginning.\n2. Since only 25 - 30 Ds will be voting for this (and we need her to be\none of those) she will feel alone as a D.\nACTION REQUESTED:  Ken, could you or someone senior at Enron place a\ncall to Rep. Jackson Lee to voice strong support for TPA?\nAn appropriate message is that we want her to focus on good public\npolicy.  We are not defending the process.  This is about good\neconomics.  TPA benefits her consituents.\nWe have attached a study that highlights the benefits of trade in her\ndistrict.  This may be useful information.  It has employment numbers\nand more.\nThe TPA vote could come next week, as early as Tuesday.  A call to her\nhere in Houston at 713-655-0050 would be appropriate, as the House is\nrecessed until Tuesday.\nThanks in advance for your positive response to this request.\n <<Texas 18 final PDF.pdf>>\nJim Kollaer\nPresident/CEO\njkollaer@houston.org\n713/844-3601\n - Texas 18 final PDF.pdf << File: Texas 18 final PDF.pdf >> ",

This\n> is not intended to be a final product release.\n> The functional component of the portal is\n> currently under development, and will not be\n> fully tested in a manner that is suitable for\n> public release by 10/31. (This includes client\n> side validation, file upload, error pages,\n> confirmation pages, etc.) Future portal releases\n> will have these features enabled.  Unlike the\n> earlier proof of concept release, no usability\n> tests will be conducted on the release 2 portal\n> version.

That \nwill get you there.  Another tool is visualizing - every night before you go \nto sleep, shut your eyes and visualize yourself on your little bike, going \nacross the map from Houston to Austin - over and over and over.  It works!  \nI've done it!\nIf virtual training won't be enough, get out this weekend on your bike - and \nhere's some great ideas for you.  Of course, we have the Tour deCypress, but \ndon't try to keep up with CHARLA REESE - she got a brand new bike and she is \nSMOKIN.'   This is a great ride - the first 40 miles is wonderfully scenic, \nand that last 40 miles is great resistance training in the wind.\nSunday  - April 2 - 7:30 AM - 50, 62 or 85 miles\nCypress Spring High School - FM 529 and Fry Road  \nSponsor: Northwest Cyclery - 713-622-1240\nSaturday - April 1 - 8:00 AM - 32, 45 or 63 miles   (HBC ride)\nCypress-Prairie View - Flat roads through ranching and rice farming country \naround Waller and Hockley.  Very little traffic.  Eat after the ride at The \nKettle at US290 & FM1960.  MEET:  29 miles NW on US-290 to Cypress-Rosehill \nRoad, north 2 miles to Huffmeister.  Park in HL&P's parking lot on west side \n- farthest from the building.  Ride Starter:  David Dick @ 713-781-6052.\nSunday - April 2 - 8:00 AM - 40 or 62 miles\nChappell Hill - One of the prettier rides for wildflowers in the spring.  The \nshort route heads north on FM1155 for 7.5 miles to the stop sign at FM2193, \nthen heads east on FM1155 another 12 miles to Washington on the Brazos State \nPark.  The long route turns left at the stop sign, travels west on FM2193 and \ntakes a winding route through some minor hills before ending up at the \nWashington on the Brazos.  There are bathroom facilities and water/soft \ndrinks available at the park.  MEET:  Take Highway 290 from Houston, about 65 \nmiles (12 miles past Hempstead) until you come to the flashing light at the \nintersection of Highway 290 and FM1155.  There's a sign that says \"Chappell \nHill\" to the right.  Turn right on FM1155 and go about 1 mile to the center \nof town.  The 2nd street on the right is \"Poplar.\"  Take a right and go a \nblock or two past the church and park on the side road connecting Poplar and \nProvidence.\nHappy Pedaling!

This information includes Counterparty Name, various \nAddress data such as documentation (confirmation), headquarters, and \nsettlement (including wire bank, ABA, and routing), and various contact names \nand phone numbers such as trader, settlements, etc.\nFor Global Credit Aggregation to be supported most efficiently, all Enron \ncompanies must utilize a common identifier for the counterparty on a trade, \ni.e., Southern Energy Marketing for Portland = Southern Energy Marketing for \nECT = Southern Energy Marketing for EES = Southern Energy Marketing for \nEPMI.  Global Credit must 'see' exposure from each affiliate for a \ncounterparty as the same party to aggregate to a corporate level.\nFor Portland General, the list of trading partners are mostly parties we \nalready have in the GCP database.  However, there will be some counterparties \nthat are specific to Portland General (the same could also be true about \nEES).  For that reason, I would like to train specific individuals at each \ncompany to perform the GCP administration/maintenance for their \ncounterparties much like we handle the ECT London and Calgary operations.  \nWhat we will have is a system shared as depicted below :\n \nThere would be select individuals at each company to maintain their \ncounterparty information via Terminal Server in a common database maintained \nhere in Houston by ECT IT.   This type of access would give these individuals \naccess to Counterparty data for all companies regardless of their own company \naffiliation. Each company/business unit will have an extract or view from the \nmain database of only their counterparties to support their trading and \ndownstream systems versus those systems being integrated directly with the \nmain database containing all information.\nWhat I need to know is whether any of you see a problem with this 'sharing' \nof technology and data between ECT and PGE or EES and the intended \nimplementation.  Based on Bill Dassenko's understanding of the FERC Code of \nConduct, we think this proposal is within the guidelines.  Please provide any \ncomments or your acceptance of this proposal by Monday, December 21st.    \nThank you.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT on 12/14/98 08:43 \nAM ---------------------------\nDebbie R Brackett\n12/11/98 04:48 PM\nTo: Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Counter Party Name List\nMary,\nThis is the list we talked about.

Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid at 77 cents on $1 of face value and offered at 81 cents, down more than 3 percent from yesterday, traders said. \nEnron, whose shares plunged 90 percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a management shakeup, said it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive. \n``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates Enron shares `hold' and doesn't own them. ``They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks difficult.'' \nDynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. The difference between Dynegy's offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than 45 percent from 29 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data show. \n``It's become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren't 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6 million Enron shares. ``There's just so much information that is unknowable'' about Enron's financial position, he said. \nSEC Filing \nLast week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has $8 billion invested in ``non-core'' businesses, including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India. Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt. Enron expects to get ``billions'' from the sales, Whalley said, without being more specific. \nEnron wouldn't comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts. Asset sales valued at about $800 million are expected close by the end of this year, the company said yesterday in its third-quarter filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission. \nMost of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close, according to the SEC filing. \nDynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares. \n``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion in debt due) would be that large, coming due all at once,'' Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place.'' \nEnron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share, bringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according to the SEC filing. On Nov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million. \nA drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership, the company said in the filing. \nWithout repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the partnership's assets, Enron said. The company said it's working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. \nEnron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments. \nChief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. \nFourth Quarter \nMaking good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said. Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by $700 million, the filing said. \nChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It provided the first $1.5 billion a week ago. \nShares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $2.51 to $84.42 in midmorning trading. Dynegy fell 50 cents to $43.05. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston. \nEnron's Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy. Before the buyout was announced, Enron stock had fallen 90 percent this year. ",

During day two of a Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) s=\ntructural separation workshop they warned that granting the AT&T request to=\n break up BellSouth into wholesale and retail companies would be leading Fl=\norida consumers down that same path. G. Mitchell Wilk and Carl Danner told =\nthe PSC today that the California Commission's concerns about possible util=\nity generation market power led it to force utilities to sell off fossil fu=\nel generating plants. This action ultimately resulted in rolling black outs=\n and forced utilities and ultimately the State to buy that power back at hi=\ngher prices. \"Florida can learn through California's mistakes. A breakup wi=\nll intensify a contradiction between cost-based wholesale prices and subsid=\nized retail rates. Since retail processes must follow wholesale costs, a br=\neakup will accelerate an end to forced subsidies,\" said former PUC Commissi=\noner Wilk. \"The costs of the breakup are large and will affect all customer=\ns. By contrast, the alleged benefits are entirely speculative, and have bee=\nn forcefully disputed.\" Danner also told Florida Commissioners that a break=\nup would be costly and difficult to reverse. \"The public wants convenience =\nand simplicity, but will get more confusion, complexity and cost,\" said Dan=\nner. \"Competitors will see this as one more means to use the regulatory pro=\ncess against one another by trying to plunge the PSC into micro-management.=\n All this new industry cost will be paid for by consumers and will subtract=\n from Florida's economy.\" Wilk added that a true debacle in what is now an =\nefficient and evolving telecommunications network might occur through struc=\ntural separation actions. \"California failed by seeking to deregulate elect=\nricity generation, while using a highly-regulatory approach to do so,\" said=\n Wilk. \"The breakup proposal here in Florida would attempt the same by adop=\nting highly intrusive regulation, at a time when there is robust competitio=\nn in the state. It would be economically counterproductive for the consumer=\ns and impede on the evolution of technology in Florida.\" CONTACT: BellSouth=\n=09",

I imagine David is starting to feel a little cocky, given we should be\nundefeated going into Texas, but he may still need to seek the shelter of\nthe study, as I know Texas is not going to roll over and play dead.\nSounds like Meagan has a full agenda this Fall and a trip to Norman would\nonly get in the way. I'm sure David will not let the fire die, if she is\ntruly interested in OU. FYI, OU's Spring Break is March 17-25 next year. So\nyou can plan accordingly. Let me know if you decide when you decide to come\nup and I can get you lined up with Prospective Student Services for a tour.\nAlso, I remember you telling me about your concerns about grades. I know\nthat OU requires a 24 on the ACT, or finish in the top 1/3 of your\ngraduating class. It is my understanding that will soon be increasing to 26\nor top 30% of graduating class. Looks like OU is following UT on tightening\nentrance requirements.\nI can get you shirts caps, sweatshirts, etc. for OU, UT and Tech. You can go\nto Bigtimesports.com and look at the styles. I think they are also in the\nschool colors. If you see a style you like, let me know the size shape and\nschool and I can order it. If some of it is for you, let me know, as they\nhave different styles for women. Also, I can have logo's etc. reduced (like\nI did on your Bevo on your shirt) so they are not so big. I always have them\nreduce the OU from 1 3/4\" to a\n1 1/4\" size, so I don't look like a \"poster boy\" for OU.

With the ages of the\nkids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our\nhome tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that\nup. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of\nOklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second\ncake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate\nparty!)\nWe were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on\nthat last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the\nfootball season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that\nwe may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on\nthe drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to\nThanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the\nspring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with\nMeagan.\nWe are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.

One of the questions he asked was what the ICC=\n could do to improve competition in Illinois.

But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears\nsting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only\nwords that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this\nsuffering.\nYou monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.\nWhat lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our\nWorld Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would\nlearn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed.\nDid you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. Did\nyou want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. Did you want to\ntear us apart? You just brought us together.\nLet me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a\nfamily rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a\nfamily nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending\ntremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae-a singer's\nrevealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're\nwealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material\ngoods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain\nsense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent,\nthough-peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right\nthing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people\nof faith, believers in a just and loving God. Some people-you,\nperhaps-think that any or all of this makes us weak. You're mistaken. We\nare not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by\narsenals.\nIN PAIN\nYes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're\nstill grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still\nworking to make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect\nfrom some Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom\nClancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the\nprobable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the\nworst acts of terrorism in the history of the United States and,\nprobably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we have never\nbeen bloodied before. But there's a gulf of difference between making us\nbloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its\nbitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time\nanyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are\nrighteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this\nlevel of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any\nlength, in the pursuit of justice.\nI tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you,\nI think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble\nwith dread of the future. In the days to come, there will be\nrecrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose\nfailure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from\nhappening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of\nrevoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,\nchastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.\nTHE STEEL IN US\nYou see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of\nour character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On\nthis day, the family's bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will\nweep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in\ndefense of all that we cherish. So I ask again: What was it you hoped\nto teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the\ndepths of your hatred. If that's the case, consider the message\nreceived. And take this message in exchange: You don't know my people.\nYou don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what you just\nstarted.\nBut you're about to learn.",

Below is a brief description of the group's \npurpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone in \nadvance for what I know will be a successful effort.\nWhat this group is about:       Identifying best practices within Public \nAffairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources and \ndocumenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possible \nthroughout Public Affairs.\nHow we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.\nWhy we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financial \nresources.... because we have an obligation to direct those finite resources \nto their highest and best use.\n  \nWhen we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January \n7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).\nWhat's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of how \nyour group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resources \nare allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (should \nbe distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).\nFinally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last year \nto implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I will \nprovide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel free \nto call me if you have any questions before then.\n*  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this working \ngroup.  Congratulations.\nCopy of E:mail sent on 12/15/99\nPlease read the attached memo from Rick Shapiro along with the attachments.\nThanks.\nCopy of E:Mail Sent on 10/19/99\nPlease see the attached Word document for directions on a new on-line \nprocedure for RCR's.  All RCR requests must now be submitted on-line through \nthe Project Tracking system.  To access the system, click on the first link \nbelow, and a new icon will be added to your Lotus Notes desktop (it has a \npicture of a globe).  (Don't click on the other two links, they'll be added \nautomatically.)    If you have any problems accessing the system, please call \nme.  If you have any questions on entering the information, please call me or \nGinger.  Thanks!!\nClick on this link  -->     > Gov Affairs\n > Projects\n > Contacts\nInstructions:  -->  \nCopy of E:mail sent on 8/25/99\nUpon further reflection after the recent staff meeting, I have made the \ndetermination that any and allengagements of outside resources, e.g., outside \ncounsel & consultants, public relations firms, etc... must be approved \nthrough the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process.  Accordingly, the $2500 \ntrigger that had been in place is no longer.  To ensure that the process \nworks in a more timely manner, I am creating weekly RCR meetings (Harry, Jim \n& myself) at which all pending RCR's will be acted on.  I will deal with \nemergency RCR's as they may arise between the weekly meetings.\nBottom line, the RCR process is of enormous value to the group as it helps to \ndocument that we are properly focusing the company's resources in the places \nwhere it is of most value.  I firmly believe that whatever minor \ninconveniences this change will entail, they are minor in relationship to \nensuring the success and credibility of the RCR process.\nMemo sent on 3/18/99",

These rule changes, which have been filed with\nthe CFTC and thus may become effective at any time, will be implemented\nupon the launch of enymexK.\nAn unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange's\nwebsite.  A hard copy \"black-line\" version of the rule changes, which shows\nchanges from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson\nat (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange's Legal Department.\nThe rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,\naccountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and\na summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access.\n     Trading Rules\nA number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the\nroll-out of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX\nACCESS7 and enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has\nbeen retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system.\nEFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange's rules that\nrespectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded\nonly on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules\nwill now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions.\nSettlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (\"enymexK Settlement Price\nProcedures\") was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for\nelectricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement\nprices generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee,\nor if the Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using\nthe same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However,\none difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no\nsettlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid\nor higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)\ncontracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available\nfor execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By\ncomparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would\nallow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and\noffers that would be protected in the settlement!\n process.\nPosition Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four\nphysical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX\nRules 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months\nand a spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.\nAlso, the Exchange's current hedge exemption procedures will be made\napplicable to the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled\nenymexK contracts, the rule amendments provide for position accountability\nacross all contract months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a\nreporting level of 25 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same\nreporting level currently used for many other Exchange contracts. However,\nNYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding\npossible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these\nreporting requirements to the CFTC for the cash-settled contracts.\nBrokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage,\nnew Rule 9.04A (\"enymexK Trading\") permits brokerage to be done for enymexK\nproducts.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member\nwill be financially responsible for trades done for each account it\ncarries, even if there is a system malfunction.\n     Arbitration Rules\nThe Exchange's arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Member\nenymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a\nNon-Member enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be\nsubject to Exchange arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory\nbasis.\n     Summary Disciplinary Procedures\nThe sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member\nenymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system.\nConsistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a\nsummary disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action\nwhen necessary on an expedited basis.\nPlease note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue\nto be subject to Exchange rules.\nIf you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact\nChristopher K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX\nLegal Department, at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate\nGeneral Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207.\n      Carr Futures\n      150 S.

The issue is to what extent Japan\nwill/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems \nto\nbe setting the pace, at least for the moment.\n* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan\nwill in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to\ncover this in EPSA.\n* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the\nback-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact\nsituations arise.\n* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to\nimmediately address any failures.\nI hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to \ndistribute\nit to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.\nBest regards\nPaul Davis\n <<Energy Trading Paper.doc>>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\n--------\nThis is an e-mail from Baker & McKenzie - Tokyo Aoyama Law Office (Qualified\nJoint Enterprise Offices).

Apparently, he has been working with DoE on a security project that he expects will be funded by them.  I believe this will be the digital certificate type of security the OSC has talked about in the past (the E-Marc proposal).  Instead of being used as originally intended to provide authentication functions for reservations and scheduling, it looks like it is being considered for securing informational items as well.  From what I understand, Pacific Northwest National Labs and Lockheed Martin have been in discussions with NERC about providing service under this DoE initiative.\nHe also stated that NERC plans to limit access to more data soon - perhaps as much as the entire NERC website, so that viewers must be registered with NERC, in order to do background checks and such before giving access. \nOne caveat - Bob sometimes likes to inflate his work to make himself appear more important (check me out, I'm talking to DoE and big contractors), so this may really be a few casual phone calls and general statements, rather than any sort of formal project.  But given the action we've seen lately, it may be a real project we should be investigating further.  I expect that once the board gives the go ahead, NERC plans to run this through as quickly as possible and rush for a quick implementation.  \nI would guess the likely approach is going to be, following an approving board decision, a relatively quick lockdown of their site, to be followed by a priority-one security infrastructure project like the one described in my first paragraph.  I would not be surprised if they also encourage other entities to lockdown their systems more tightly.  \nI don't know if there is any real action we can take right now, but obviously, this draws more attention to the issue as we move forward into next week.  Obviously, please be discreet in mentioning these details, as I don't want Bob to get skittish.  These issues may not be confidential, but then again, they might.\nPlease also note that I did not include Dick Ingersoll on this communiqu?.  I am not sure under what disclosure policies he is still bound (if any).\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771 \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tYeung, Charles  \nSent:\tFriday, October 12, 2001 1:35 PM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Cromley, David\nCc:\tBestard, Jose; Ingersoll, Richard; Rodriquez, Andy\nSubject:\tExcerpt From MSNBC Article\nWEB SITES REMOVE DOCUMENTS\nU.S. government departments and agencies also have been stripping a wide range of documents from Web sites in recent days because of perceived threats to such critical systems as pipelines, water supply stations and power plants. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, for instance, took down its entire Web site Thursday to review its content for \"information that might be useful to adversaries,\" said spokeswoman Rosetta Virgilio. \nShe said many other federal agencies also appeared to be in the process of removing such information from their sites. \nThe Transportation Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics has cut off public access to databases used for mapping because of stepped-up concern about U.S. transportation infrastructure. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has dismantled its risk-management Web site, which contains general information about emergency plans and chemicals used at 15,000 sites nationwide.

As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly.\nIf it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. \nI trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.\nI trust all is well,\nDoug Gilbert-Smith\nDirector, Ercot Trading\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tTheriot, Kim S.  \nSent:\tTuesday, November 27, 2001 10:06 AM\nTo:\tDay, Smith L.\nCc:\tGilbert-smith, Doug\nSubject:\tTexas PUC Request\nImportance:\tHigh\nSee info. below.

Thank \nyou.\n----- Forwarded by Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT on 02/14/2001 07:25 AM -----\n\tDaniel Reck\n\t02/13/2001 01:48 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT\n\t\t cc: \n\t\t Subject: WebModal\nAt Monday's EGM meeting, Mike McConnell asked me to describe the WebModal \nacquisition EGM made last week.  Following is a brief description of the \nfreight capacity market and what WebModal gets us:\nMarket\nThe US market for logistics is $600bn annually.  We are pursuing the largest \nhomogenous segment which is long-haul truckload and intermodal.  That market \nis $50-$100bn annually, depending on who you ask and whether you include \ndedicated fleets.\nThe interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely \nfragmented and massively intermediated.  There are over 100,000 trucking \ncompanies (carriers) in the US and thousands of independent brokers (brokers \nin this market act as credit principals).  10-20% of all loads are conducted \nin the spot market (brokered) and the rest are done under 1-3 year contracts \nthat are generally non-firm, but define the relationship between each shipper \nand their chosen carriers or intermediaries.\nOn the rail side, the US railroads act as wholesalers, selling their capacity \nto Intermodal Marketing Companies (IMCs).  The IMCs then retail or broker out \nthat capacity to shippers.  The difficult part of ground intermodal is that \nthe rail haul makes up only the long-haul component.   The trip from the \norigin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the \ndestination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck.  \nThis first and last mile transportation is called \"drayage\".  \nWebModal\nWebModal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they \nlook identical to truck.  They have a database with prices and schedules from \nall the RRs and 48 drayage companies that gives them complete US coverage.  A \nbuyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive \ninstantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service.\nBecause of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail \nand truck, the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is \nsignificant.  For any move greater than 500 miles, intermodal is generally \n20-30% less expensive than a single driver truck move.  The substitutability \nof intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price.\nThe WebModal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise \nand a good head start as we enter this market.  The next move will be to \nbuild a truck intermediation capability.  \nI encourage you to meet Chris Kravas the CEO of WebModal.  He will be \nspending all of his time in Houston when he is not on the road.\nPlease give me a call if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nDan Reck",

Larry Campbell, Dave Ryan, Kayne Coulter and Joe Quenet, all who missed 4 games.  Dave, Kayne and Joe picked Baltimore and Larry picked Tennessee. Therefore, if Tennessee wins, then Larry will win outright. If Baltimore wins tonight, then it will come down to total points scored. Dave picked 24 points, Kayne has 29 and Joe had 56. Dave will win with Baltimore and 26 or less points, Kayne will win with Baltimore and between 27 and 42 points, and Joe will win with Baltimore and 43 or more points. \n\tWe only had 22 entries this weekend, therefore the prize will be $66.

We did meet some years ago at a conference\n> in Houston when I was a VP of Union Gas, Ontario, Canada, which was later\n> bought by Westcoast Energy and to which I migrated.\n>\n> I served as Vice President, International, of Westcoast Energy Inc. for 5\n> years after Union Gas.  A year ago I elected to form my own consulting\n> company when Westcoast constricted its international program in Asia, my\n> prime area of interest at that time, to fund Alliance and their Mexican\n> projects.  I remain on very good terms with Westcoast and have since done\n> considerable work in Mexico for them.  Our Asia work was a real success,\n> and we built the first Canadian power plant in China, and acquired and\n> expanded a $550 MM US power plant in Indonesia.   Both are business and\n> technical successes, and both were developed and built under my\n> leadership.\n>\n> My current 8 month consulting assignment here in Mexico City for a large\n> multi-national joint venture wraps up this month, and I am now seeking\n> other employment. We would be happy to stay in Latin America/Caribbean, go\n> back on the Asia beat, or try another geographical location.  My\n> preference is contract work, full or part time, although I would consider\n> full time permanent employment.  I thought perhaps Enron might have\n> opportunities for someone with my experience and talents.\n>\nMy interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by\ntraining, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20\nyears.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy\nstrategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from the\ninternational plan I did as the first ever VP, International at Westcoast\nEnergy.\n> One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast\n> Energy's Asia business development and operations, we invested (with\n> partners) over $600 MM US in five years with a total staff of 5 (including\n> clerical), and a write-off rate of 0.14% of capital invested - possibly a\n> record low.   I have good systems for risk review and mitigation, and  to\n> screen projects, countries, partners, and  agents.\n>\n> The contracts I have been working on in Mexico are Pemex contracts, but\n> are similar to the contracts used by CFE for IPPs, and drafted by the same\n> law firm,  if Rosarito is any example.  Having worked on $60 MM claims\n> under these contracts, I am very familiar with the problems that these\n> contracts have, the various possible interpretations, and the possible\n> \"fixes\".   If, as I suspect, Enron are interested in more power\n> development in the rapidly expanding/opening Mexican IPP market, I believe\n> I could offer solid advice on the contracts, the players, and the risks.\n>\n> The first page of my CV is below in e-mail form.  If it is of interest,\n> the complete CV is attached.  A list of services my consulting company\n> provides is available upon request.  We are basically a boutique business\n> consulting firm, consisting of former senior executives of Canadian energy\n> firms/governments.  Some of us, myself included, offer multi-lingual\n> capabilities.\n>\n> I can be reached in Mexico City at phone (52) 5290-0117, fax (52) 5291\n> 9627 or at the e mail in the CV at any time, or at this e-mail for the\n> next two months.\n>\nI would appreciate if you could circulate this note and my CV to the\nappropriate parties in Enron.\n> Sincerely,\n>\n> John Hunter, P.

But TVA is still\nspending more than $700 million for all of the new plants and contracting to\nspend more money buying power from other producers in the Tennessee Valley.\n\"Our summer peaks are growing from 2 to 3 percent a year and we need these\nunits to meet our power demand,\" said TVA spokesman Gil Francis. \"These are\nthe most reliable and best-cost option for us at this time.\"  With an extra\n600 megawatts of capacity from eight of the gas- or oil-fired turbines this\nsummer, TVA officials insist they are ready for an expected record-breaking\ndemand for electricity later this year.\n\"We don't control the weather,\" TVA Senior Vice President Greg Vincent told\nagency directors earlier this week. \"A real extreme weather event could\ncause us problems, and a lot of other people problems. But outside of that,\nwe have taken every measure we can.\"  TVA consumers demanded a record 28,295\nmegawatts last July 30 when temperatures across the valley averaged 96\ndegrees. TVA projects the demand will be up 2 to 3 percent this year because\nof the growing number of homes, businesses and air conditioners in its\n7-state service territory.\nTVA is adding four gas turbines at both its Gallatin and Johnsonville fossil\nplants in Tennessee. The turbines will cost about $200 million and give TVA\na total of 28.  The agency will build another eight units next summer, and\nits board on Wednesday approved a $246.8 million contract with General\nElectric for another 680 megawatts of peaking power from eight more units.\nThose units, equipped to burn either coal or oil, are scheduled to come on\nline in June 2002.  \"There's a long waiting period for these units, so\nyou've got to get in line to get them ready when you need it,\" Mr. Francis\nsaid.\nBut the scheduling and cost for the peaking units is far less than building\na major power plant. The Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant, which TVA began in\n1972, wasn't completed until 1996. The Unit 1 reactor alone cost $6 billion\nto complete.  To pare its $27 billion debt, TVA's board adopted a 10-year\nplan three years ago to limit new borrowings and to turn to other suppliers\nor peaking units to meet future energy growth.  Next year, TVA also has\ncontracted to begin buying up to 440 megawatts of power from the Red Hills\nPower Project, a privately owned, lignite-powered plant in Mississippi.\nTVA has a backup plan this summer to buy up to $100 million in electricity\nfrom outside its system if needed to ensure it has a cushion of about 16\npercent, Mr. Vincent said.  Drought conditions that could have limited power\ngeneration from TVA's 29 hydro units eased some with early April rains.\nHowever, valley rainfall still stands about 11/2 inches below normal for the\nyear.\nGary L.

The=\n=20\nresult is much better information (attendance, grading, assignments,=20\nmessages, etc.) but the schools only need a simple computer with a browser =\nto=20\naccess the service. If one computer breaks, they simply move to another=20\ncomputer and access the service.

Also, parents can access essentially real time information about=\n=20\ntheir child=01,s grades and attendance, and can easily communicate with the=\n=20\nteacher through the messaging.\n?\nWhen I met with them in April, I liked the idea but was consumed with=20\nQuestia.

Since March last\nyear, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure\nliberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10\npower utilities regional monopoly.\nHowever, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and\nthat further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The\nJapanese government is due to review the process in 2003.\nFolder Name: Enron Reuters folder\nRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 9",

His name was Kyle. It looked\nlike he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, \"Why would anyone\nbring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd.\" I had\nquite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends\ntomorrow (afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.\nAs I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They\nran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him\nso he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in\nthe grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible\nsadness in his eyes. My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over\nto him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw a tear\nin his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said, \"Those guys are jerks.\nThey really should get lives.\" He looked at me and said, Hey thanks!\"\nThere was a big smile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real\ngratitude. I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As\nit turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen\nhim before. He said he had gone to private school before now. I\nwould have never hung out with a private school kid before. We talked all\nthe way home, and I carried his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool\nkid. I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with my\nfriends and me. He said yes. \nWe hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, \nand my friends thought the same of him. Monday morning came, and there \nwas Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said, \n\"Boy, you are going to really build some serious muscles with this pile of \nbooks\neveryday!\" He just laughed and handed me half the books.\nOver the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we\nwere seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on\nGeorgetown, and I was going to Duke. I knew that we\nwould always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going\nto be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle \nwas\nvaledictorian of our class. I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He \nhad\nto prepare a speech for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having\nto get up there and speak. Graduation day came, and I saw Kyle.\nHe looked great. He was one of those guys that really found him during\nhigh school. He filled out and actually looked good in glasses. He\nhad more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.\nBoy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those days. I could see\nthat he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back and\nsaid, \"Hey, big guy, you'll be great!\" He looked at me with one of those\nlooks (the really grateful one) and smiled. \"Thanks,\" he said.\nAs he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began.\n\"Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through\nthose tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings,\nmaybe a coach, but mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you\nthat being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her. I\nam going to tell you a story.\"I just looked at my friend with\ndisbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill\nhimself over the weekend.\nHe talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do\nit later and was carrying his entire stuff home. He looked hard at me and\ngave me a little smile. \"Thankfully, I was saved. My  friend saved me from\ndoing the unspeakable.\" I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this\nhandsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I\nsaw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not\nuntil that moment did I realize its depth. \nNever underestimate the power of your actions. With one small gesture you can \nchange a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts us all in\neach other's lives to impact one another in some way. Look for God\nin others.\nYou now have two choices, you can:\n(1) Pass this on to your friends or\n(2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your heart.\nAs you can see, I took choice number 1. \"Friends are angels who\nlift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly.\" \nIt's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you really\ncare.\nEleanor Roosevelt wrote: \"Many people will walk in and out of \nyour life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart.\"\nTo handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your\nheart. Anger is only one letter short of danger. If someone betrays you once, \nit is his fault; if he betrays you twice, it is your fault. Great minds \ndiscuss ideas;\nAverage minds discuss events; Small minds discuss people. He who loses money, \nloses much; He, who loses a friend, loses  much more; He, who loses faith, \nloses all.\nBeautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old\npeople are works of art. Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live \nlong enough to\nmake them all yourself. Friends, you and me.... you brought another\nfriend.... and then there were 3. We started our group.... our circle of\nfriends.... and like that circle.... there is no beginning or end. Yesterday \nis history... \nTomorrow's a mystery. Today is a gift.\nIt's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you\ncare. Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND. If\nit comes back to you, then you'll know you have a circle of friends.\nWHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU'RE REQUESTED\nTO SEND IT TO AT LEAST 10 PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PERSON \nWHO SENT IT TO YOU.

The\ngoal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside\nattacks.\nSecurity Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development\nby the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more\nsecure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from\nsoftware vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security\ndivision of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the\nLinux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or\nPC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating\nsystem. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off\n\"buffer overrun\" and \"format string\" attacks, which take advantage of\nloose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating\nsystem and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed \"Lion\" was recently\nidentified as using this method to hack Linux servers.\nNSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses\nin the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux\nproject to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type\nEnforcement protects the operating system and applications by\nsegmenting them into security \"domains\" with specifications on what\ntypes of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this\ncould be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an\napplication, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with\nVMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for\nallowing users with different security access to work on the same\nserver.\nThe good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives\nis that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once\nfinished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include\nSELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more\nbulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.\n_______________________________________________________________\nTo contact Phil Hochmuth:\nPhil Hochmuth is a staff writer for Network World, and\na former systems integrator.

The TURN approach is\ntotally unacceptable and we should oppose, in our view.  I will also forward\nthis to the CLECA members for their review.  Here are some of things wrong\nwitih the TURN approach:\n* The suspension of DA is retroactive to July 1, 2001.  \n* All of the language we had in subsection (h) regarding treatment of\ncontinuous DA customers has been removed and replaced with a very limited\nexemption for plants on the site of the customer.\n* Any customer who was a bundled customer for even a day is responsible for\nthe full panoply of exit fees.\n* The DWR forward exit fee is calculated simply as the difference between\nthe DWR portfolio cost, say 10 cents, and the cost of contracts in the\nmarket at the time of the determination, say 4.5 cents today.  There is no\nlook at net short.  Each DA customer would be assessed the 5.5 cents in my\nexample, plus DWR historical and Edison undercollection fees.  A total of\n6.5 to 7 cents in my example.  Ts makes DA totally uneconomic.  Further, in\nassessing the DWR portfolio cost we are to look at the minimum purchase\nlevels, thereby raising the per kWh cost due to demand costs.\n* Finally, the language adds to the CPUC's rules on coming back to bundled\nservice, including the provision of notice by the customer before it\nreturns.  And it adds language authorizing the CPUC to adopt reg's for DA\nafter the utility takes over the net short purchase obligations from the\nDWR.\nThis is really bad language in my view.  As we discussed yesterday, it makes\nDA uneconomic.  I think we should oppose it.\nI heard from Derek Naten, SVMG's lobbyist, just now.  He informs that Rick\nSimposn and Lawrence Lingbloom say the Edsion undercollection cut point will\nmove up to 125 kW.  Rick told him that DA is out of the bill entirely.\nLawrence told him that DA will be adressed in a bill under Debra Bowen's\ncontrol, and that Debra had a good proposal all along and that the business\nguys had screwed it up.  \nAre we making progress?  \nBill",

The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.\nThe Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  \nPioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .\nTW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:\n\t1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;\n\t2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.\nItems to Verify:\n 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral\n 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)\nOpportunities for TW:\nBy Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.\nA lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.\n ",

Understanding that \"new\" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  \nThe 3 choices I see are:\n1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.\n2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.\n3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.\nIt seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.\nThe commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.  MDS",

We forwarded the funds to pay=\ndown your personal Bank of Amercia (BA) LOC.   The Family Partnership had t=\no borrow from your personal line at BA $200,000 to  cover the $588k cash ca=\nll for SRE properties.  With today's closing prices,  the Family Partnershi=\np's available BA line is between $25k-$50, which is an  estimate because mu=\ntual funds don't post their NAVs until around 5pm (Central  time).  That ma=\nkes the Partnership's  total payable to KLL/LPL  personal line at $1,303,50=\n0.\n=20\nI contacted the guys regarding the BBT Fund (Bass  family).  Per our conver=\nsation, I told them that the timing was bad,  but we did not want to miss o=\nut before they close the fund.  I indicated  that our initial investment wo=\nuld be the following: KLL/LPL personal $250,000;  KLL & LPL Investments, Lt=\nd. $100,000; Foundation ? (possibly  $100,000).  The initial investment amo=\nunt for the partnership, and  possibly the foundation, are about as low as =\nwe can go if we want to  get into the fund.  I am aware that the Foundation=\n is waiting to as  long as possible to pay out any contributions os I wasn'=\nt sure if we wanted to  make something happen there.  Also, I indicated tha=\nt we would prefer  to fund as late as possible, which looks like July  .  I=\nf we decide on doing something in the foundation they  have an Offshore Par=\ntnership to eliminate the tax implications of UBIT.   The Offshore Partners=\nhip is run exactly the same as the Onshore version, but is  unitized and pa=\nys a dividend rather than distributions to the investors.

As outlined below the client 'Borealis'  wishes to change the terms of the contract given our current situation.  RAC is comfortable with the changes, as it will result in a significant saving in storage costs and allow the LPG trader to flatten his book. Further, whilst there maybe the potential of MTM movement between the $180 purchase price from Borealis and the subsequent sale (index related price) back to the counterpart, this will be netted out.  RAC has significant risk appetite for this counterpart, which is a sound credit, rated E5.  The only issue is whether Houston has sufficient resources or are willing to pay the storage costs early, which could range between $1,200,000-?1,400,000.  If this is feasible I will recommend that we negotiate a discount of $15 on storage costs (saving $600,000) as opposed to $10.  \nKind rgds,\nNish\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPetersen, Bo  \nSent:\t27 November 2001 17:45\nTo:\tPatel, Nish\nSubject:\tLondon - LPG Book\nEnron put 40,000 MT of Propane in storage under a term agreement (contract QA 8318)  in a facility \nin Sweden,  managed and owned by a company called Borealis.  Enron, under the contract, agreed \nto pay $45 per MT for the right to utilize the storage.  \nDue to Swedish law,  Enron can/could not have title to the product in Sweden and Borealis paid Enron, \nunder a pre-agreed price formula,  $186 per M/T.   Upon Enron's sale of the product and subsequent \nlifting a payment of the $186 + $45 (storage fee) would become due to Borealis.  The likely timeframe\nfor selling the product would be Jan. 2002 as that is the highest OTC swap price mkt which in turn\nwould mean payment to Borealis would be due on 30 days past B/L. ie early Feb.\nBorealis are very concerned about Enron's ability to meet it's payment obligation and has suggested\na transaction that in several ways would suit the LPG book.\nPls let me know if you need further information.\nBo Petersen \n1.\tAn upfront payment (this week)  of the storage payment with a reduction of \n$10-$15 dollars for the storage fee.  $400,000-$600,000 savings\n2.\tBorealis would purchase the Product in tank at an indexed related price\nwhich would fit the London LPG book very well\n3.\tThe contractual obligations to lift the storage tons would be further complicated\nby the fact that the one physical trader most likely will not be here much longer.\nPls let me know if you need further information.\nBo Petersen\n \n\t\t\n ",

Hatch\nChairman, Trade Subcommittee\nFinance Committee\nUnited States Senate\nWashington, DC 20510\nDear Senator Hatch:\nPresident Bush has asked me to respond to your recent letter regarding the\ntroubling developments in the U.S. steel industry. The Administration is\nvery concerned about the issues you have raised.\nThis Administration is committed to the swift and strong enforcement of the\ntrade laws. There are currently more than 150 anti-dumping and\ncountervailing duty actions in effect or under investigation relating to\nsteel products. In addition, the steel industry is currently receiving\nimport relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 for line pipe and\nsteel wire rod products.\nHowever, despite the measures that are currently in place, we continue to be\nconcerned about the health of the steel industry. I and other senior\nAdministration officials have begun meeting with representatives of the\nsteel industry to determine what additional actions are needed. We are\ncarefully considering all options, including further action under Section\n201 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.\nWe will continue to monitor conditions in the industry and will take\nadditional actions as needed to strengthen the future for U.S. steel\nworkers, their employers and our nation's economy.\nSincerely,\nRobert B.

We have now \nreformulated our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will \nsimply be sent to the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to \nsign and return any documents.\nWe believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the \nETA by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL \nsystem will mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master \nagreement.  We do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the \nETA.  Obviously for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented \nwith the 'Accept GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system. \nIn addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating \nthat we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the \ncredit provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty \naccept the GTC over the master!!).\nObviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.  I \nalso presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in \nthis way will be effective under New York law. \nBest regards,\nEdmund.",

So since I'm at the computer I decided to e-mail you so\nthat you can remember (smile).\n Thanks for everything!\n________________________________________________________________\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\nJoin Juno today!

The Sena=\nte Energy Committee will look into what impact Enron's demise has had on en=\nergy markets.  The Washington bureau will have complete coverage of Enron d=\nevelopments on Capitol Hill.   The White House could find a lawsuit on its =\ndoorstep next week.  General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Wa=\nlker says he could decide as early as Wednesday whether to sue Vice Preside=\nnt Cheney over the administration's decision not to turn over more informat=\nion regarding the work of his energy task force.  The GAO has never filed a=\n similar lawsuit in its history, but Vice President Cheney maintains the re=\nquest is inappropriate.     FERC Chairman Pat Wood addresses a meeting of t=\nhe American Public Power Association in Washington on Monday.  The Washingt=\non bureau will have details on the APPA meeting and coverage of the regular=\n FERC meeting on Wednesday.  The FERC meeting includes a closed-door sessio=\nn on the start of a possible FERC investigation.    There's another whistle=\nblower in the Enron case - on Monday, the Houston bureau will speak with th=\ne attorney for a woman who says she knew there were problems at Enron.  We'=\nll also have updates on the investigation into the death of a former Enron =\nexecutive.    On Monday, ENL's Kym McNicholas talks to Phoenix Consulting's=\n Susan Schneider about some recent California ISO filings with the Federal =\nEnergy Regulatory Commission.  Schneider will also discuss the California P=\nower Authority's Energy Resource Investment Plan.   Williams Energy Partner=\ns L.P. CFO Don Wellendorf joins us on Monday.

If you ever need\nto  leave the  list,  you  will find  the  necessary instructions  below.\nPerhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all\nfuture subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail\nfolder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you\nare subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on\nvacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up\nyour  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  \"welcome\nmessages\" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after\nsubscribing to a new list.\nTo send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,\njust send mail  to RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. This is  called \"sending mail\nto the  list\", because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERV\nmakes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address\n(RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG)  is also  called the  \"list address\".  You must\nnever try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed\nto all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the\n\"LISTSERV  address\",   LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.  It   is  very\nimportant to understand  the difference between the  two, but fortunately\nit is  not complicated. The  LISTSERV address is  like a FAX  number that\nconnects you  to a  machine, whereas  the list address  is like  a normal\nvoice line connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the\nFAX number  when you  wanted to talk  to someone on  the phone,  you will\nquickly realize  that you used the  wrong number and call  again. No harm\nwill have been done. If on the  other hand you accidentally make your FAX\ncall  someone's  voice  line,  the  person receiving  the  call  will  be\ninconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. The\nfact that  most people  will eventually  connect the  FAX machine  to the\nvoice line to  allow the FAX to  go through and make the  calls stop does\nnot mean  that you  should continue  to send FAXes  to the  voice number.\nPeople would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much the same way with\nmailing  lists, with  the difference  that  you are  calling hundreds  or\nthousands of people  at the same time, and consequently  you can expect a\nlot of people to get upset if  you consistently send commands to the list\naddress.\nYou may leave the list at any  time by sending a \"SIGNOFF RRGA-L\" command\nto LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You can also tell LISTSERV how you\nwant it to confirm  the receipt of messages you send to  the list. If you\ndo not trust  the system, send a \"SET RRGA-L  REPRO\" command and LISTSERV\nwill send you a  copy of your own messages, so that you  can see that the\nmessage was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while\nyou  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mail\nprogram does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informs\nyou that new mail has arrived from  RRGA-L. If you send a \"SET RRGA-L ACK\nNOREPRO\" command, LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead,\nwhich  will look  different in  your  mailbox directory.  With most  mail\nprograms you  will know immediately  that this is an  acknowledgement you\ncan read  later. Finally,  you can  turn off  acknowledgements completely\nwith \"SET RRGA-L NOACK NOREPRO\".\nFollowing  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options\nhave been set to \"NOFILES REPRO\" rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults.\nFor more  information about subscription  options, send a  \"QUERY RRGA-L\"\ncommand to LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.\nContributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a\nlist of the available archive files  by sending an \"INDEX RRGA-L\" command\nto  LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You  can then  order these  files\nwith a \"GET RRGA-L LOGxxxx\"  command, or using LISTSERV's database search\nfacilities. Send an  \"INFO DATABASE\" command for more  information on the\nlatter.\nThis  list is  available  in digest  form.  If you  wish  to receive  the\ndigested version of the postings, just issue a SET RRGA-L DIGEST command.\nPlease note that  it is presently possible for other  people to determine\nthat  you are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  \"REVIEW\"\ncommand,  which  returns   the  e-mail  address  and  name   of  all  the\nsubscribers. If  you do not  want your name to  be visible, just  issue a\n\"SET RRGA-L CONCEAL\" command.\nMore  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV\nreference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an \"INFO  REFCARD\"\ncommand to LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.",

What do you think?\nRosie\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Jim Kollaer\" <jkollaer@houston.org>@ENRON  \nSent:\tThursday, October 18, 2001 3:33 PM\nTo:\tLay, Kenneth\nCc:\tAnne Culver\nSubject:\tSheila and the Trade Promotion Authority\nKen, I am writing to ask Enron's assistance with a pro-Trade Promotion\nAuthority message to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.\nThe position of the Partnership and Enron are well known to Sheila.  She\nconsistently has voiced doubts about her ability to vote for trade\nissues such as China PNTR and fast track/TPA, but in the end joins her\npro-business and trade colleagues in supporting these measures. You have\nalways been a very effective lobbyist on this issue.\nMost recently, on October 10, 2001, Rep. Lee told Rep. Norman Dicks\n(D-WA) (he was the first D to be a supporter of this new compromise leg\n(HR 3005) and is whipping the issue for the Ds) that she is a no vote on\nTPA (HR 3005).\nRep. Lee's reasons for not supporting this issue are as follows:\n1. The process has been too partisan, Ds like Rep. Charles Rangel were\nnot consulted and brought to the table to develop compromise language in\nthe beginning.\n2. Since only 25 - 30 Ds will be voting for this (and we need her to be\none of those) she will feel alone as a D.\nACTION REQUESTED:  Ken, could you or someone senior at Enron place a\ncall to Rep. Jackson Lee to voice strong support for TPA?\nAn appropriate message is that we want her to focus on good public\npolicy.  We are not defending the process.  This is about good\neconomics.  TPA benefits her consituents.\nWe have attached a study that highlights the benefits of trade in her\ndistrict.  This may be useful information.  It has employment numbers\nand more.\nThe TPA vote could come next week, as early as Tuesday.  A call to her\nhere in Houston at 713-655-0050 would be appropriate, as the House is\nrecessed until Tuesday.\nThanks in advance for your positive response to this request.\n <<Texas 18 final PDF.pdf>>\nJim Kollaer\nPresident/CEO\njkollaer@houston.org\n713/844-3601\n - Texas 18 final PDF.pdf << File: Texas 18 final PDF.pdf >> ",

The \ncrux of the recommendation is that Rae would like to take a procedural vote \nat the March 2 Board meeting on whether the Board intends to move forward \nwith pursuing retail standards.\nIf the procedural vote is \"yes,\" then she is proposing to have Jay Costan and \nBill Boswell start drafting the governance documents.  I mentioned that I \nwould like to participate in reviewing the Bylaws and Certificate as your \nrepresentative.\nI think that the attached backround and Feb. 14 meeting summary is fine.  I \nhave lots of thoughts on the possible organizational structure document -- \nbut these are probably best saved until the Board votes on its intentions.  \nI'd say the procedural vote is too close to call at this point.

        "original_email": "Date: Tue, 18 Dec 2001 15:11:58 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: chairman.enron@enron.com\nTo: dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com\nSubject: Organizational Announcement\nBody: \nAs things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.\nOrganizational Matters\nThe Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.\nFrom an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.\nBy now, you must have heard of \"NETCO.\" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.\nAs for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.\nPersonnel Matters\nAs a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.\nOffice of the Chairman - Enron Corp\nJeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.\nTreasurer - Enron Corp\nRay Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.\nCorporate Development\nMark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.\nWholesale Services\nThe Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.\nManagement Committee Departures\nUnfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:\nMichael Brown\nMark Frevert\nSteve Kean\nMike McConnell\nJeff Shankman\nAdditionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.\nWe know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.",

There will be very little difference to users \nof the sheet, but behind the scenes we have substituted calling an Oracle \nstored procedure via ADO for what we had before, which was executing a SQL \nstring via DAO.  When you go to pull in the daily data you may notice a \nslight difference in the form: the choice we had before of selecting between \nADO and DAO is gone.\nThere is one difference in the sheet you need to know about.  This concerns \nwhat happens when a deal with a counter party that does not exist in our \nlocal counter party tables comes in via the Oracle query.  In the past, this \ncounter party and the deal's hourly amounts would appear in the spreadsheet, \nbut when we went to write CAPS templates, that counter party would not \nappear.  Someone would then tell me needed to add the counter party to our \nlocal counter party tables.\nNow what will happen is that the name UNKNOWN will appear in the sheet with \nthe hourly amounts for the missing counter party.  As before, whatever this \nmissing counter party is will not appear in the CAPS templates.  You will \nstill need to tell us what counter party is missing.  You will figure out \nwhich one it is in the same way you have in the past.  We are working on a \nprocess that will look up these missing counter parties and takes care of \neverything automatically.",

Thanks.\nDJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n(This article was originally published Thursday)\n     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission \nlikely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall \nprofits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and \ncustomers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.\n     A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating \nthe wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the \n\"expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done.\"\n     \"Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court \nto decide if generators should refund money,\" the commissioner said. \"I don't \nthink the state is willing to spend the money or the time.\"\n     In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison \nInternational (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit \nPacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their \nratepayers, the commissioner said.\n     A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added.\n     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support \nhaving generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The \ncommission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's \ntroubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence \nthat would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to \ndocuments obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.\n     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate \nthe market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said \nrates were \"unjust and unreasonable.\"\n     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also \nconcluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in \norder to drive up wholesale power prices.\n     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to \npass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.\n     The commissioner said \"if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the \nutilities would be left holding the bag.\"\n     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale \npower. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a \nstate-mandated rate freeze.\n     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive \nOfficer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover \nmore than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay \noff employees and reduce major capital spending.\n     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow \nthe utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.\n     -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; \nmailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com\n     (END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-11-00",

I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.  \nShe wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete \nit in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken \nout of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the \nmeeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did \nnot deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use \nthe enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of \npaying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future \nundefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that \nwas being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of \ndefault.  \n If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.

How will my\nimmigration status be affected when my employment ceases?\nA:  Your work permit is specific to Enron and is not transferable to\nany other employer without additional processing by the INS.  A\nnon-immigrant (H-1B, L-1, TN, etc.) is out of status once s/he has been\nterminated.  Once the non-immigrant is out of status, in theory, s/he should\ndepart the US as soon as possible.  If the non-immigrant can find a new\nemployer and file within approximately 30 to 60 days from the date of\ntermination, the INS has generally overlooked the violation of the\nmaintenance of status.  Keep in mind this is not a hard and fast rule, and\nthe INS has the ability to enforce shorter or longer periods on a\ncase-by-case basis.\nIf you are offered another job in the US your prospective employer\nwill have to apply for a new work permit on your behalf.\nIf you do not get another job in the US and you wish to remain here\nthen you must seek permission to stay on other grounds.\nUpon termination, the foreign national should contact an attorney and\nschedule a time for a full consultation (in-person whenever possible)\nregarding all issues.  There are often many issues which need to be\naddressed as each person's immigration issues are unique.\nI hope this is what you are looking for.  Let me know if we need anything else?\nThanks\nMargaret",

I would\nlike to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.\nAs I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing\npower markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it\nseems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the\n\"forgotten resource\" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a\nlot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many\nresearchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was\nasked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give\nit the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by\npolicymakers.\nFrank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a\nuseful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major\nsponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron\nthat the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate,\nit requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the\nconference is widely circulated among key government groups.\nI would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and\nrecommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to\nparticipate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of\nproviding funding for this effort.\nThank you,\nHill Huntington\n - retail notes.rtf\n*******************************************************************\nHillard G.

However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount \nof risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any \nindex-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I \nhave been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of \nother ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum \nrate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  \nHowever, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical \nchange in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW \nlacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.\nWhy the problem exists (you may already know):\nSteve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in \nthe first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the \nCommission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for \nnegotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a \ncost-of-service based tariff rates.  \"[T]he availability of a recourse \nservice would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that \nthe customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline \nunilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the \nrecourse rate mitigates market power.\"  \nThe Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest \nrate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its \ntransportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly \nnot limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper \nwilling to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely \nbecause someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  \"When there are \nmore requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the \npipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either \nthe negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata \nbasis if required by its tariff.\"  The example cited by the Commission:  If a \npipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one \nwho is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a \nnegotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata \nbasis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some \nother allocation method such as lottery).  \nWhen TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added \nthe statement that \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the \nrate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.\"  Presumably we had \nconcluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order \nto receive negotiated rate authority.  \nSolutions??\nI would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language \noutright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been \nchasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I \nkeep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is \nwhere I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  \nSteve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the \nrecourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still \nhave to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic \nwarns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive \nproposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.\nAnother idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more \nthan max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  \nWe've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more \nthan max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, \ndespite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely \nwe can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be \nable to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But \nI just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that \nrecourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either \nof you seen anything to the contrary?  \nI would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to \ndiscuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to \ndiscuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few \nminutes.  Thanks. \n ",

The \nother questions I had about last week's rent are:\n#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is \ngoing on?\n#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit\n#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?\nI spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with \nemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know \nthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the \nproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show \nthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  \nRegarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right \nnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet \nbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade \ncontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the \nproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and \nbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  \nRemember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It \nis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move \nin that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I \nrealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and \nyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be \nworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are running \nan errand for the property.\nI am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this \ntime.  We can look at again later in the year.\nI will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.\nPhillip",

Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  \n3) EarthSat will issue an \"official\" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.

Please don't distribute to the large group until it is reviewed.\nFirst, Lindy I have put the annual strip prices at the bottom of the \"rolloff\" tab.  Could you fill in the basis spread pricing that would result from this?\nSecond, Kevin and Rod - I had to give up on the FVA adjustments made in older models, I just couldn't get it.  Here's what I did; please let me know if there is something wrong with the analysis:\n?\tIBIT has annual FVA subtracted from it\n?\tCash taxes are calculated using IBIT - Interest + FVA + tax/gaap depreciation adjustment\n?\tGAAP taxes use IBIT without FVA; deferred tax is GAAP-cash tax.\n?\tNet income is IBIT less GAAP taxes (therefore includes FVA amort)\n?\tNet Plant includes PP&E depreciation + FVA amortization\n?\tRetained earnings are standard - old RE + NI - Div's.\nIn the old model there were tax adjustments, pluses & minuses to equity, deferred credits, & current liabs that just didn't make sense to me.  I hope I've captured the theme of FVA (non-cash charge to NI, not deductible for tax) without the complication.  If not I can add it all back.\nBest-\nDavis",

The proposed Applicable Construction Purchase Date (between 5 and 15 \nBusiness Days after the date of the notice).? By my count we don't have 5 BDs \nleft in the year.? If you want to do by year end you will need a waiver.\n2.????? The Specified Option Property - which should be described with \nsufficient specificity for the Developer to prepare a legally sufficient \nquitclaim deed or bill of sale and assignment pursuant to 7.1 of the DCMA, \nand the party owning the property (Developer or Developer Subsidiary or \nother).? For your purposes now, this should be fairly straightforward - we \nwill be doing just a Bill of Sale and an assignment.? Serial numbers, \nlocation and any other information for positive identification of any \nequipment should suffice, and as to contract rights that is just a reference \nto the appropriate contract(s) and the rights to be assigned thereunder (if \nnot all).? In future, this element will be driven by the type of Property you \nare taking out. \n3.????? Designate the amount of Project Costs Attributable to the Specified \nOption Property.? Note that this works hand in hand with the voluntary \nprepayment section under the PA, Section 2.1G for Phase I.? I assume you're \nin LIBOR right now, so you need to give a minimum 3 B.D. notice of \nprepayment, and it is irrevocable. You might as well incorporate the notice \nof prepayment into the Purchase Option Exercise Notice.\nThe Developer will need to produce and deliver a Bill of Sale and an \nassignment based on the information you provide, so please copy me on the \ninformation you send to CSFB.? \nI have not had an opportunity to discuss this with Jon (generally or about \nthe waiver issue) or anyone else, so please go ahead and start on the notice \nwith the knowledge that there may be further comment and a requirement for \nfurther information.? Why don't you produce one version that includes a \nrequest for a waiver of the 5 Business Day requirement and an \"acknowledged \nand consented to\" signature line for CSFB as Admin Agent.? As you suggested \non the phone, it may be worthwhile to produce a form for this kind of \nnotice.? Let's consider doing that after the first of the year so we can be \nsure to anticipate all that must be included. There may be other items we \nwant to establish a form or precedent for too, depending on what features of \nthe facility you see Enron using frequently. \nLet's speak about this early today, obviously. And we must be sure we have \nenough Business Days left in the year to pull this off - LIBOR Business Days \nwould be the only problem I could imagine, I'm just unable to check that \nright now.\nTalk to you soon, I'll be in the office by 9 or 9:30.? And why did it take \nyou so long to get active on this facility? Such a nice credit and you just \nlet it sit there for days! \nCheers, Karl \nThis e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential \ninformation.

This supersedes my last \ntransmission on this subject, because the Navy has just released a new RFI \nfor a grouped series of bases in California.\n 1.  Navy, Southwest. \n  a.  Pt Huneme/Pt Mugu were intended as the first procurement on a bundled \nbasis, but they are on hold awaiting funding for Phase 2.  They need to do \nlife cycle cost analysis,  system condition assessment, and inventory.  A \ndraft RFP will be issued to industry for comment.  The final RFP, \noptimistically (according to the NAVFAC SWDiv Commander) could be out as \nearly as this quarter.  Doug Powell, the Contracting Officer, says a more \nrealistic date is April-May of 2000.  However, Ralph Torres, the NAVFAC \nBusiness Line Manager for this procurement, is attending a PACFLT meeting \nthis month in Hawaii to try to hurry this up. \n  b.  A new RFI has just hit the street, due 15 Nov 99, for electrical, gas, \nwater, and wastewater privatization at 5 USN locations in Southern \nCalifornia.  These are Naval Warfare Assessment Station, Corona, CA; Naval \nAir Station, Fallon, NV; Naval Air Station, Lemoore, CA; Naval Weapons \nStation, Seal Beach, CA (Main Station); and Naval Weapons Station, Seal \nBeach, CA (Detachment Fallbrook).    \n 2.  Marines,Southwest.  \n  a.  NAVFAC intends to combine 29 Palms, MCLB Barstow, MCAS Yuma and MCRD \nSan Diego into one procurement.  We have responded to the RFI, as we have in \nthe case of the Navy, 1.a, above.  NAVFAC has has funding for Phase 2 for \nBarstow and 29 Palms, but not for the other two yet.  The RFP is expected to \nhit the street in the April-May, 2000 time frame.\n  b.  NAVFAC intends to combine Camp Pendleton, a large base in CA, with a \nsmall base used for mountain warfare training at Bridgeport, CA.  The \ncombination is being made for funding lines and chain of command reasons.  \nThe real plum here is the very large Marine base at Pendleton.  The RFP  is \ncurrently scheduled for release April, 2000, but we think it will be a few \nmonths later to have the above 4-base procurement hit the street first.\n 3.  Navy, Northwest.  NAVFAC intends to release virtually all their \nNorthwest activities in a single solicitation.  This includes the following \nlocations:\n  -Naval Subase bangor\n  -Camp Wesley Harris\n  -Olalla Housing\n  -Port Hadlock\n  -Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport\n  -Naval Station Bremerton\n  -Naval Hospital Bremerton\n  -Jackson Park Naval Houising\n  -Naval Fuel Depot Manchester\n  -Naval Station Everett\n  -Naval Radio Station Jim Creek\n  -MWR Pacific Beach\n  -Naval Air Station Whidbey Island\n  \nEFSI was invited to present at their Industry forum in Seattle where this \nprocurement was announced on 4 Aug 99.  An  RFI is out, with response due 15 \nNov 99.  The final RFP is scheduled to be released in Jan 01.\n 4.  Joint Regional Privatization Project (JRUPP) Alaska.  This is an \nagreement with the USAF and the US Army to combine their facilities at \nElmendorf AFB, Kulis ANG Base, the Army National Guard Base, and Ft \nRichardson all into a single procurement.  DESC is the project manager.  An \nRFI for these locations just hit the street.  Our retired friend, USAF COL \nDon Michael Bradford instigated this joint procurement, and is still a good \nsource of information in the Pacific.  Procurement is being accelerated with \nthe USAF catching up to where the Army is, so schedule for an RFP is \ncurrently unknown.  USAF RFIs have just been published.\n     ",

The size of the new interconnect will be 40,000 \nMMBtu/d.  EPFS has agreed to pay $165,000 towards the cost estimate of \n$280,000 as well as commit 12,500 MMBtu/d throughput for a period of 2 \nyears.  Facility Planning is opening a new work order and we have begun \ndrafting the Interconnect Agreement and the OBA for the new point.  The point \nshould be active in 60 - 90 days.\nArizona Public Service - has still not signed the Transport Request for the \n14,000 MMBtu/d April - October 2001 capacity.  The current spread is $0.375 - \n$0.40.  \nRed Cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5 \nyear agreement.  Contract documentation is being prepared.\nSempra - has again exercised their option under their Gallup contract for \n21,500 MMBtu/d Permian to California for 1 year starting 11/1/01. The \ncontract rate is $0.30 plus fuel.\nTexaco is moving up to 100,000 MMBtu/d from PG&E Topock to Mojave starting \n8/21 through 10/31/00.  TW collected an incremental $.025/MMBtu for this move \nor approximately $160,000.\nEl Paso Outage-\n Current reports are the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding El Paso hydro \ntest, X-ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out \nof service due to last weekend's explosion.  It appears the 1 Bcf/d capacity \nto California may be off-line for up to one month.  \nRelated Developments\n  --SoCal released capacity on El Paso for October 2000 to Dynegy at a \nreservation charge of $1.00/MMBtu.\n  --Volume on various TW interconnect points has picked up on the east end \nincluding the new NGPL Winkler point.\n  --We are receiving incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and \ncollecting a portion of the market premium. \nTransport Options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled \nfor Thursday August 31.  The objective will be to get everyone comfortable \nand build a coalition of support behind our new Options Tariff filing.\nBurlington Resources - We held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing \nDirector, regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.  Our data \nindicates,with the exception of a few T-5 temperature limit days, TW has been \nable to accept over 98% of the gas nominated by the plant.  In addition, for \nthe last 2 years, the plant has been delivering gas with CO2 in excess of our \nspecs.  We agreed our latest amendment draft could use some stronger language \nin terms of TW's obligations beyond a \"best efforts\" basis.   John indicated \na willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of \n215,000 MMBtu to us for Hub delivery.   We agreed to talk again next week \nonce the volume test was complete.",

This request is made in an attempt to lower ProjectMax expansion costs.  Our goal is to make this transaction work for $0.02/MMBtu/day.  This would be for the winter only, 15 years, beginning 11/1/2003.\nDuluth:  Negotiations with Duluth regarding avoiding a bypass have been slowed by Bud Krause, Manager of Systems Operation.  He is indicating that he now feels that there may not be enough \"value\" in the deal for Duluth.  Bob Stevens is setting up a meeting with NNG management and Duluth. \nPricing & Storage\nPipeline Capacity.  Analyzed (in conjunction with Facility Planning and Gas Control) potential model changes that provide for incremental 60 mm/d Zone EF capacity and 100 mm/d of Demarc-North capacity that will require minimal facility changes (Sean Bolks has been key in this effort).\nFDD.  Review possiblities for purchasing 3rd party storage for potential backstopping of FDD requests that were received during the recent open season.  We received requests for 3-5 Bcf of FDD above our ability to provide service from our own facilities.\nTransport Deal.  Finalize Jan - Mar Tenaska transport deal for Field capacity.  Total demand charges of ~$540,000.\nPreparing to capitalize on incremental transport and storage deals that may arise due to colder Market Area weather that is anticipated for the next 6 - 10 days.\nTI Business.  Continue Field Area TI business analysis in an effort to maximize value from TI shippers.\nProject Development\nProject MAX / MGO - Contacted Wayne Fransdal this Friday to review the latest information regarding options to serve requirements of the Benson branchline. Identified critical facility scope and cost issues that need to be shared with Wayne to drive the decision process and structure a deal that will be acceptable. Will be working with Facility Planning to complete the information and run through our rate model.\nProject MAX / Excel - Received a late request from NSPWis requesting incremental service on the La Crosse branchline. Info forwarded to Facility Planning. Will analyze impact to other shippers that participated in the Open Season on a timely basis and decide how to handle the late request. Hopefully, will be able to accommodate NSPWis w/o any problems.\nJAL - Working on a proped sale of facilities to Sid Richardson and a proposal to review w/ management. Goal is to have the package ready by the end of next week or week after. \nCO2 ISSUE - Continue to work w/ Facility Planning to develop the best alternatives utilizing the treating facilities at Lyons. Goal is to have the project fully scoped by the end of the year.",

There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under \nthis category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are \nhitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  \nCurrently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  \nThe problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these \ncounterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the \nproducts after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.\nRISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies \nwith Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two \nlegs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment \nof FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the \nappropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for \nFinancial Swaps and not Physical deals.  \nIT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked \ncorrectly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will \nmost likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg \nMaintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to \ninstruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so \nlogic can be adjusted accordingly.\nDoes a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any \nfurther issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    \nPlease respond with your thoughts on this subject.\nThank you,\nDawn\n3-9353",

The cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, but we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.

In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kitchen, Louise \nSent: Monday, October 29, 2001 5:56 PM\nTo: Schneider, Chip\nCc: Calger, Christopher F.\nSubject: RE: Longview DASH Request\nsorry missing the message\nWhen are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.\nPayments and payment dates please.\nThanks\nLouise\nPlease say not soon too.\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tSchneider, Chip  \nSent:\tMonday, October 29, 2001 7:26 PM\nTo:\tKitchen, Louise\nCc:\tCalger, Christopher F.\nSubject:\tLongview DASH Request\nLouise:\nA termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.\nTo extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.\nTo extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.\nTermination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.\nRegards,\nChip Schneider\n713-853-1789\nECN2864\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>",

I would argue that the Directors in some of the groups look to be a fairly important part of the equation, but I don't have a strong feeling one way or the other.    I know we (ETS) do not use the senior director title in accounting because in ETS it is reserved for basically multifunctional roles or jobs that are typically a VP level responsibility (i.e. - in charge of field operations for a company).

        "original_email": "Date: Tue, 27 Feb 2001 07:33:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: rebrooks@earthlink.net\nTo: rebrooks@rbac.com\nSubject: El Paso Statement on California Situation\nBody: \nIn case you haven't already seen this:\nEl Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )\n HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG)\nreaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties\ninvolved to help improve California's energy situation. \"We are surprised\nto see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Paso's\ninvolvement in California,\" said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of\nCorporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. \"We\nwould like to take this opportunity to clarify the record.\"  The\nsignificant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power\nsupplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which\nhas in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate\nelectricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than\na cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were\ndeliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas\npipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not\npossible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to\ncause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use\nthat capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post\nthe availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is\nobligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate\nfound to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso\nNatural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to\nserve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a\n\"conspiracy\" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into\nCalifornia are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The\nfacts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either\nbuilt or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer\nsupport to justify their construction. For example, despite years of\nmarketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be\ninduced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed\nAltamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately\ndropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two\nbillion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation\ncapacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it\nwas misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess\ncapacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to\nencourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and\ncontinuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation\ncapacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way\nto assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity\ninto California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy\nwhatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there\nwere periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available\non the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands\nat that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used\nby shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities\nfor future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in\n2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999,\nreliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in\nprices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or\navoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California \"energy crisis\"\nwas caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California\nto keep pace with the state's economy and increased demand. A combination\nof factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction\nof new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily\nregulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped\nin-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and\nincreased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power\nnormally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased\ndemand for power in the western United States drove up prices that\nCalifornia had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies\nderegulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers,\nleaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their\ncosts. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased\ncosts to consumers, the utilities' creditworthiness was impaired, causing\nsupplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and\nexpensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of\npeaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand\nconditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable\nat critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power\nplants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air\nemissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold\nweather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power\ncosts in California could have been substantially mitigated through\nlong-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term\npower market.  \"California is currently in a difficult position, but now\nhas the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term\nenergy policy,\" said Dunn. \"El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers\nof energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively\nparticipating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term,\nstable solution to California's energy needs.\"  El Paso Corporation, the\nlargest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the\nenergy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in\nexcess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural\ngas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the\nNorth American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing,\nmost sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nation's third largest\nnatural gas producer. El Paso, a leader in risk management techniques, is\nfocused on maximizing shareholder value, transforming existing markets, and\nspeeding the development of new markets.

This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave \nof panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive \nwhen  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an \nescapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are \nstanding next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not \nhearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. \nMaking a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. \nJAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) \nDefinition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns \npace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this \nshould happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left \nthe  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  \nCOURTESY FLUSH \nDefinition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of \nthe  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an \nundisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has \nto stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the \nWALK OF SHAME. \nWALK OF SHAME \nDefinition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you \nhave  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  \nif someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to \npretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a \nCOURTESY FLUSH. \nOUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER \nDefinition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You \nwill often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   \nnewspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for \nthe Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. \nTHE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) \nDefinition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency \npooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor \nthe whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. \nSAFE HAVEN \nDefinition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you \ncan least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the \nopposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering \nthe bathroom. \nTURD BURGLAR \nDefinition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and \ntries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and \nvulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this \noccurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you \nwill avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. \nCAMO-COUGH \nDefinition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the \nbathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a \nWATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used \n in \nconjunction with  an ASTAIRE. \nASTAIRE \nDefinition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD \nBURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that \nthe stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom \nimmediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. \nWATERMELON \nDefinition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet \nwater.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  \ncoming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. \nHAVANA OMELET \nDefinition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes \nin the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a \nCAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. \nUNCLE TED \nDefinition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could \nspend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  \npot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as \n you \nshould  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This \nbenefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. \nFLY BY \nDefinition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, \ncheck for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and \ncome back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may \nbecome suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. \nCRACK WHORE \nDefinition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. \nTell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. \nAvoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans \neach particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK \n WHORE \ncan become a SAFE HAVEN.  ",

        "original_email": "Date: Tue, 29 Aug 2000 04:38:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: steven.kean@enron.com\nTo: robert_zoellick@gmfus.org, stelzer@aol.com\nSubject: Upcoming Advisory Council Meeting\nBody: \nI'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the \"reregulation threat\" at \nthe next meeting.  Below are some of my observations:\nWhile it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the \ntriple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and \nhigh natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some \nof the data).\nThere is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national \npolitical issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to \"big oil\" \n(which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and \nCongressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing \nto have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant \ncharacteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque \nreliance on the market).  \nNotwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its \nprominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at \nleast on the electricity issue.  We did some focus group testing recently in \nSouthern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego \nprice quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it.  So, while the issue \nhas the potential for political traction, it may not have caught on yet \n(except in places like San Diego and New York city.\nThe reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in \nelectricity markets.  Investigations of out of state \"price gougers and \nprofiteers\" have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have \nbeen put in place.  They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets.  \nSuppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high \nelsewhere in the West, power flows out of California to those other markets.  \nIronically, though I can't explain it in classical economic terms, the \nsetting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling \nprices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than \nenough supply.  For the most part, though, the caps and the other political \nreactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to \nthrow the deregulation plan out and start over, and the retail price caps \nhave been relatively narrow ... so far.\nOutside of California, the authors of other states' deregulation plans have \ndistinguished their proposals from California's.  Regulators and legislators \nfrom such diverse places as Connecticut, Texas and Alberta have gone out of \ntheir way to defend their plans and explain why \"California won't happen \nhere.\"  For the most part, then, the reaction to California has been positive \nfrom Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated.  There does \nremain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant \ndivestiture) may be postponed or cancelled.  The story is a bit more grim in \nstates that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with \ntheir plans:  I think it's off the agenda in most places.  The fact that most \nof the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already \nderegulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard.\nAt the federal level there has been a combination of the \"burn the village in \norder to save it\" approach  -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure \nto reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for \ncomprehensive reform.\nAll in all, I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an \nopportunity:  business is booming;  we sell protection from price volatility \nand the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of \nmajor newspapers.  On the public policy front we need to convert the \ncontroversy into productive action.  Our target has been FERC -- they are \nsomewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a \nsingle commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the \nmarket.\nEnron's response:  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry \ngroups and let them carry the message; our concern was that Enron -- a \ncompany which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not \nmake the most attractive champion for the open market message.  We hoped that \nthe new generators in Cal would take up the mantle.  It's fair to say that \nthey fumbled the ball:  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the \nutilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state \nprofiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief.  They were \nalso extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message.  We are \nnow working the issue directly.  We are working the issue on a number of \nlevels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to \nnumerous reporters and editorial writers.  As time goes on, the information \nand reporting has gotten somewhat better.  2)  Govt relations - we have been \npushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to \nbuild capacity but the government won't let it).  This may be the best \nenvironment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process.  Also, in \ntypical Enron fashion, we put a deal on the table.  We offered to sell power \nto the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable \nrates for their customers at below current rates.  Our offer was followed by \nnine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was \noffering better solutions than California politicians.  SDG&E dropped the \nball, unfortunately.  Instead of seizing the opportunity, they ended up going \nalong with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue \na massive deferral account.  At the federal level we are contacting members, \nthe DOE and FERC.  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish \n\"leveling the playing field\" in wholesale markets so power can get from where \nit is to where its needed.  Additionally, we are developing a prepackaged \nsystem (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away \nany lingering excuses or delays).  3) Overall messaging -- we have been \nworking with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their \nresonance at the grassroots level.  As we hone these messages we will be \nusing them in the fora we are currently working.\nOverall, we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment, but \ncapitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot.\nAn intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this:  much of the problem in \npower markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices, particularly natural \ngas.  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are \nadvocating for electricity, so how can we maintain that the problem in power \nmarkets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on \nthe planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices?  The answer is \nsomewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current \ndebate:  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were \npre-deregulation;  long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( \nthe curve is \"backwardated\" (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are \nlower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current \nspot prices); and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic \ninputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid \nthe spike?).  When all else fails, a big part of the problem can be blamed on \nOPEC.  We haven't had this thrown at us yet, but we are trying to anticipate \nit and have answers at the ready.\n This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The issue is a great example of the \nintersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should \npromote a lively discussion when we get together.  Let me know if there is \nanything else you need.",

I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the\ntechnical level and otherwise.\nI promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for\na visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was\nclearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -\nmine is rather terrible:\nFriday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter\nSunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron\nto be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to\nvisit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in\nJapan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.\nFriday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably\nis too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within\na window of opportunity for attracting top students for this\nresearch. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be\nimportant for the student support funds to be in place then, so\nthat I can make hard commitments to students and attract top\ntalent. I am already reviewing files of students who have\napproached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing \"soft\ncommitments to star-level students\" to get this research and its\npotential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought\nafter by advisors and I want to be an early player in this\ncompetition.\nDoes my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the\nproject and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the\nend of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can\nhappen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.\nI assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets\ngoing. Please let me know what you think.\nBest Regards,\nNick",

Victoria said that before she would be prepared to discuss the substance of her letter she would need to speak with Tom and Wayne.  She did; however, mention that neither she nor her client understood why Enron had been so anxious to dissolve the company when her client had several potential buyers very interested in the company. She mentioned that if Enron didn't want to put any more money into AMPS, it should have worked with DP to find a buyer.\n    I told Ms. Westerhaus that it was my understanding that a bona fide buyer was not lurking on the horizon and that there was no way that the company could have continued operating. She said that AMPS could have suspended operations instead of dissolving.  She then inquired as to whether the company had, in fact, been dissolved.  In response to that question, I told her that my last meeting about AMPS had been over a week a ago and I had no additional information. I then suggested a conference call between Enron, its counsel and DC and its counsel to try to bridge the parties difference's before the towels wee thrown I n.

Unfortunately it wasn't what =\nwe wanted to hear.\nOn the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=\ne turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =\nthey are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =\ncustomers received a letter letting them know about it.\nOn the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=\nommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =\nbeen ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=\n IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=\nously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =\nsubmitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=\nides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=\ntch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=\nhen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =\nde-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=\nann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=\nw contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=\nRed to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=\nrs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =\nour larger customers through the reps.\nSo - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=\nn annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =\nthey're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=\n .......\n1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=\non, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =\nPeggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.\n2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=\n as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=\nived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=\ne should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=\ne will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=\n  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =\ndon't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=\nta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=\nhird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20\n3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =\nas of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=\nIX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=\non.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20\n4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =\nthose given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =\nis impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=\nn, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=\nlly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=\nend labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=\nown and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20\nLet me know your input.\nHeather",

Click here:\nhttp://www.marketmavens.com/marketmavensradio020102.rm\nHigh Percentage Trading on the S&P\nBy: James Cordier, Michael Gross, Liberty Trading Group\nFrom: MarketMavens.com, January 8, 2002\nWith the volatility and higher option premiums, the S&P can be an\nideal market for the properly capitalized trader to write option\npremium for increased returns. As we all know, this is the king of\nthe futures markets, and thus deserves the respect of the option\nwriter. For this reason, we only participate in the most\nconservative of trades when dealing with this contract. Option\nsellers (as well as their brokers) like to sleep at night. That being\nsaid, the rewards can still be very attractive.\nWhile we do not pretend to know what the stock market is going\nto do, we cannot help but get caught up in the positive outlook\nfor 2002. Barring another catastrophic terrorist attack, we find it\nhard to imagine any reason the stock market would go below the\nlows set back in September.\nFor that reason, we recommend the following simple, high\nprobability strategy which, if successful, will yield about a 50%\nreturn within 6 months.  Instead of trying to pick individual stocks,\nor trying to guess what the S&P will do tomorrow or next week, a\ntrader takes an \"alternate\" way out.\nAt the time of this writing, the June S&P is trading at about 1169.\nA trader can SELL a June S&P 825 put option and collect about\n$1,200 for every option sold. The margin to do this is around\n$2,400 per option at this time. For the option to go in the money,\nthe June S&P would have to fall over 343 points before June.\n(That is a full 125 points below the low established in the wake of\nSeptember 11th.)\nIf the market moves higher from here, it should be an easy ride as\nthe option deteriorates and expires worthless, and the option\nseller keeps the money. If the market stays steady, the option\nexpires worthless, the option seller keeps the money. If the\nmarket falls but stays above 825, the option expires worthless,\nthe option seller keeps the money. Only if the market is Below\n825 at expiration, does the seller have a loss.\nHowever, before you run out and liquidate the retirement\naccount, lets take a look at the downside possibilities of the\ntrade. First of all, this trade is only recommended for the\ncomfortably capitalized account. A drop of 100, 200, or even 300\npoints in the S&P would still not put your option in the money. But\nit may temporarily increase the value of your option and thus also\nyour margin requirement. A trader should have adequate back up\ncapital in his account if he intends to \"ride out\" such an\noccurrence. The other risk, of course, would be the futures being\nbelow 825 at option expiration, which makes the trader long the\nJune S&P at 825, not necessarily a bad thing. However, if the\nmarket continues to fall down past 825 and the trader continues\nto hold his position, losses could be substantial.\nStock traders considering this strategy should ask themselves the\nfollowing question: What type of return do I hope to make on my\nstock portfolio by June of this year? Is it close to 50%? What type\nof losses would I incur in my stock portfolio if the S&P fell to 825?\nIn the option trade, you still make 50%. In a move below 825, the\nodds are good for a lot of traders that the losses they would incur\nin their stock portfolio would be much greater than being short\nthe S&P at 825. In other words, we think this is a good way to\ntrade the stock market.\nAs we said in the beginning, we don't know what the stock\nmarket is going to do. But from a risk standpoint, we like being\nlong from 825. If you would like to discuss trading this way for\nyour account, please feel free to give us a call at 800-346-1949\nand I will be glad to discuss this strategy with you.\nFor a more detailed discussion of this trading strategy on the S&P,\nplease listen to James Cordier's interview by Michael Pinson of\nPinson Communications on the Market Mavens Radio show from\nJanuary 2, 2002.

My favorite \ntime was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to \nmake an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do \nanything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our \nhotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast \nand dinner included!  Such a deal!  \nI got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things \nleft.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant \nwhile I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.\nI've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I \nthink (if the painter is done).

Skilling\nPresident and C.O.O.,\nEnron Corp.\nDear Jeff,\nThis email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope\nyou recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my\n1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to\nintroduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an\ninnovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy\nSeshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders\nof SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific Advisory\nBoard. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your\nkeynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and\nhas been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with\nJP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed\nColloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.\nof Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge\nvalue-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, I\ndon't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by\nBob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.\nSKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in\nelectronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative\nTrading Systems). It achieves this through a process of \"strategic\nnegotiation\" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).\nOur system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to\nany extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our\ninitial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,\ne.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power\ninstruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other\nweb-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron\nOnline.\nSKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:\n1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,\nbandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,\nthe dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth\navailable, continguity of the allocation, and such.)\n2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to \"static\" matching.\n3) It is multi-lateral.\n4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.\n5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in\ntraditional markets.\nCurrently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at\nFidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,\nSalomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,\nCitizens Power, and a host of other folks.\nWe think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any\nother Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.\nSKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your\nrepresentative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in\na meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange\nsomething appropriate.\nThanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.\nWith warm regards,\nJoseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow\nCc: Professor Robert C. Merton\nJoseph A.

I mentioned to Sheri that you and Tana were working on a \nspecial project and that one of the goals was to create a Global Information \nSite or something similar, and that I had mentioned to you as well that she \nwas gathering some data for that particular purpose.\n I'm not sure what your plans are regarding the Intranet Site, but since \nSheri has already done this work I thought I would let you know in case you \nand Tana are interested in talking to Sheri and reviewing her work.  Sheri \nhas a lot of good ideas and she seems to enjoy project development \nresponsibilities, not to mention that she's had the opportunity to establish \ngood relationships with the Internet team.   \nThanks.\nNony",

        "original_email": "Date: Tue, 9 Jul 2002 15:02:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: denise.williams@enron.com\nTo: ge_benefits@enron.com\nSubject: GE's Mail Retention Policy\nBody: \nPlease familiarize yourself with GE's Mail retention Policy.  It is \nsubstantially different from what we are used to.\n--D\nGE's Mail Retention Policy\nE-mail is a tremendous productivity tool, but its volume and use carry with\nit a number of issues. Keeping up with the volume of e-mail is burdensome,\nindeed often stressful. The unnecessary retention of e-mail uses valuable IT\nresources, and the volume of unnecessary e-mail slows down our ability to\nprocess and find the materials we really need. Importantly, recent court\ncases illustrate how e-mails, which are so useful because of their\ninformality and speed, can become the subject of intense scrutiny over\nmeanings the authors may never have intended. Words and phrases intended to\nbe ironic, sarcastic or amusing can be taken out of context with\nembarrassing - and unintentionally harmful - consequences.\n  (1) Proper document retention is one important way to\ncontrol these burdens and risks. Our company policy has been to discard\nunneeded e-mail after 30 days. To implement this policy, we are, beginning\nSeptember 1, 1999, instituting automatic deletion of e-mail in primary\ne-mail folders (Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, Drafts) company-wide after 30\ndays. In addition, e-mails stored in other folders will be deleted after 365\ndays. Finally, you should save e-mails on your local hard-drive only where\nit is essential (the auto-delete will not operate on the local hard drive).\n  These automatic deletion procedures will be subject to legal\nlimits on document destruction, limits that apply to e-mails. When an\nemployee's e-mail is potentially relevant to litigation or threatened\nlitigation, counsel for your business will cause the automatic suspend\nfeature to be disabled for an appropriate time period. A second limitation\ninvolves retention of certain records required by law in such areas as tax,\nEHS, government contracts. Such limitations will be implemented on a\nbusiness-by-business basis and in corporate components.\n  Accordingly, for employees in the businesses, your General\nCounsel and Messaging Leader will be in touch with you about implementation\nof the auto delete feature in the next week or so. For corporate employees,\nBrackett Denniston and David Etue will provide further guidance shortly.\n  (2) But proper document retention practices represent only\npart of the answer to minimizing the risk that e-mails will be misunderstood\nor used improperly by our adversaries. The best solution, of course, is to\nensure that we compose our e-mail carefully and sensibly, just as we would\nany other written communication. In that regard, we are attaching a list of\ntips and best practices. Following these suggestions and practices will\nimprove the clarity of our communications and address their volume as well.\nWe believe that we can improve the use and productivity by taking the time\nto write e-mail intelligently, and by retaining only those e-mails required\nby law.\nThanks for your help.",

It was a $10k issue which was fixed in the normal \ncourse of operations and NBD in the scope of things.  The QF was never at \nrisk as the pump is a standard part which is commonly available.\nThe QF loss issue I typically worry about usually derive from an outage \nsourced at the counterparty level (cashflow problems, operational \ndifficulties, etc.)  I've seen this cause a few projects tense moments, \nalthough FERC has always allowed the projects to recover.  Typically the \nutility will protest the loss of QF but since the QF's are self-certifying \nwith FERC right to protest, the utility can typically only make noise and or \ncease paying.  \nRecently, FPL attempted to not let the Indiantown QF IPP back on-line after a \ntechnical shutdown (and thereby bust their QF), but FPL lost their case in \ncourt (wrongful act) and has had to let the project return to on-line status \n(financing and QF remained intact over the +6 month ordeal).\nTo me the general theme is that an executed and performing (energy is being \ndelivered) PPA will survive incredible QF stress.  The plant managers \ntypically have the highest level of understanding of the intricacies of the \nPPA's vis-a-vis the relationship between plant, utility and QF host.  \nHistorically, FERC is not looking to kick out a project's contract based upon \na QF technicality, although charged with enforcement of QF.  If FERC was a \ntough enforcer, Cleburne and a few other similar QF projects would rate high \non their hit list and the past speaks well to the future in this case.\nChuck",

It would be very helpful if people would \ncomment or provide analysis on the likelihood of the following settlement \npoints:  \n1. Long-Term Contracting\nkey need of CA is NEW POWER PLANTS - KEY MESSAGE - AND IT'S IN CALIFORNIA'S \nAUTHORITY TO DELIVER\nLive Auction conducted by DEALBENCH\nauction should be focused on \"build\" economics\nparties bid ($/Mwh) for the right to deliver 500+ MW (the right size needs to \nbe determined) into Cal ISO control area for 5 years and the winning bidder \nobtains a pre-approved generation site in California (with all permits, \nsiting obligations, and interconnection - BIG ISSUE) to build starting within \n2 months\nfocusing on just delivered energy without generation site is difficult to \nprice (market too illiquid)\nkeep the number of auctions to a minimum (probably 6 - 10) for each utility\nCounterparty is State of California (some agency)\nmaybe structure the bids to be 50-50 baseload vs. peaking\n2. Utility Retail Ratemaking\nper RELIANT ENERGY model, need $85/Mwh on average to work within retail \nframework (how much would rate increase does this create?)\ngoal must be to have EBITDA positive utilities, although long-term utilities \nshould be EBITDA = $0 for generation sales\nkeep the current PX structure? \nUtilities may have to \"eat\" some of the current undercollection\n3. Interim Credit Support\npro rata credit from all creditors (including banks and energy suppliers)\n60 day forbearance (to allow the auction to occur)\n4. Liability \nPG&E, SDG&E, and SCE agree not to sue any suppliers\nState of California considers \"taking\" all civil cases and not pursuing\nState of California agrees not to pursue any criminal cases\n5. Other Actions\nFERC agrees to immediate price cap lifting\nFERC and California agree to complete non-stakeholder board for ISO\nCPUC immediately finds that the result of the auction is \"reasonable\"\nThe key point is to (1) stop the current bleeding by getting long-term deals \nin place soon and (2) manage the rate shock.  We will be working three things \n(1) structure of the long-term auction, (2) rate model showing how high \nprices of long-term auction power can be, and (3) financial results for \nutilities under this outcome.\nWhat else needs to be included in a settlement?\nJim",

The FERC stated that the demand in the \nWestern US market is an  adequate rate incentive for the short term.  In \naddition, there are other  rate incentives, according to FERC, albeit more of \na long-term nature, in  esistence and at the disposal of the pipelines that \ndeliver gas in the  WSCC.  Pipelines have the right to propose market-based \nor negotiated  rates.  Pipelines can propose incentive rates.  In addition, \npipelines  can design incremental rates for projects which propose rates of \nreturn and  depreciaiton rates that differ from those used on a system wide  \nbasis.\n \nThe areas of interest to  the pipeline industry are highlighted on pp. 29-38 \nof the attached  order.\nConfidential: INGAA Member Use  only \nTerry D.

There \nare currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by \nsix dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate \ncontractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of \n40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by \nlocation as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By \ncompany, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three \ndependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; \nDPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to \ntrend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce \nthe Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.\nWe are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best \npossible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the \nevent of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of \nall 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale \nevacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon \nseason has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number \nof available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by \nindividual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same \nresources.\nAs you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in \nthe final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and \noffices there.\nDave",

Vancko\nevancko@nerc.com or\nEugene F. Gorzelnik\nefg@nerc.com\nMay 15, 2001\nNERC Releases its 2001 Summer Reliability Assessment\nThe North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) released its 2001\nSummer Assessment today.  \"The assessment concludes that California will\nexperience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this\nsummer,\" said Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, \"and California\nelectricity users will experience rotating blackouts, much more so than\nlast summer or this winter.\"  The report also states that extreme\ndrought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the\navailable output of hydroelectric resources.  \"We expect that utilities\nin the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands\nthis summer,\" he added, \"but they will not have electricity available to\nexport to California and elsewhere.\"\nIn addition, the report cautions that New England, New York City, and\nTexas should be closely watched, despite having adequate resources to\nmeet demand.  New England and New York City are particularly sensitive\nto long-term heat waves and higher-than-expected generating unit forced\noutages.  Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when\nit opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area\noperations into one.  The report concludes that generating capacity\nresources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in\nother areas of North America this summer.\n The assessment also points to concerns regarding north-to-south\ntransmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United\nStates, particularly east of the Mississippi River.  The ability to\ntransfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern\nInterconnection was severely tested last summer, spurred by cool\ntemperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south, as well as\nhigh fuel prices in the south.  Early indications are that key\ntransmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south\nare already fully subscribed going into this summer, and that\ntransmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout\nthe summer.\n As a supplement to its 2001 Summer Assessment report, NERC also\npublished a 2001 Summer Special Assessment.  This document is an\nin-depth, independent examination of the expected summer conditions in\nboth California and the Pacific Northwest, and is based on interviews\nwith experts from both the California Independent System Operator\n(CAISO) and the Northwest Power Pool (NWPP).\n NERC's CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of\nboth the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) ? the\nCAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this\nsummer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand (rotating\nblackouts) are expected.  NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater\nthan those expected by the CAISO.  NERC anticipates that firm demand may\nbe curtailed for about 260 hours over the course of this summer, with an\naverage firm demand curtailment of about 2,150 MW.\n NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to\nserve all their firm electricity demands this summer.  However, NWPP\nwill not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it\ntraditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy\noutput from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst\nwater years on record.\nThe independent reports, prepared by NERC's Reliability Assessment\nSubcommittee, assess the projected demand and the resources available to\nmeet that demand this summer, as well as transmission reliability\nissues.  The reports are posted on NERC's web site at www.nerc.com.  The\nweb site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into\nNAERO, and the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery\nprograms and activities.\n*********************\nNERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast\nblackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems\nthat serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric\nindustry as well as customers to \"keep the lights on\" by developing and\nencouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these\nsystems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account\nfor virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,\nand a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.",

The Japanese currency also rose by nearly a full yen =\nto a 3-session high of 116.19 against the euro, in spite of the Bank of Jap=\nan's continuing gloomy economic outlook for the second month in a row in Fe=\nbruary. In its monthly report, the BOJ cited deteriorating labor market con=\nditions and a worsening deflationary spiral as reasons for its pessimism. J=\nuly-Sept real GDP revised to - 0.5% q/q (vs. prel -0.5%) Japan July Sept ca=\npital spending revised to up 1.6% q/q (prel up 1.1%) Japan Jan net foreign =\nbond selling Y3.0712 trln yen (Dec Y827.1 bln selling) Foreigners' Jan net =\nJapan bond selling Y1.2368 trln (Dec Y172.22 blne selling). Separately, a r=\neport in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that Standard & Poor's rating agency=\n might change its ratings on Japanese government bonds unless Japan pushes =\nthrough reform measures or starts exhibiting signs of a rebound. In the com=\ning days, FX traders will be listening for any comments that may emerge fro=\nm President Bush's trip to Japan on February 17. Nihon Keizai Shimbun surve=\ny showed that only balancing economic stimulus pared with structural reform=\ns could bring the country out of recession. Only one out of three Japanese =\nin a survey thinks that PM Koizumi will be able to implement reforms withou=\nt sacrificing growth, employment. Japan is nervously trying to create the o=\nutline of its comprehensive policy remedy to tackle inflation ahead of US P=\nresident Bush's weekend visit to Japan. \"The problem of deflation is an ext=\nremely important issue in structural reform,\" Koizumi said and \"the governm=\nent and the BOJ must tackle this together.\" Nihon Keizai Shimbun survey con=\nducted over the weekend announced that public approval for PM Koizumi plung=\ned to its lowest level of just 55% down 23 points from November due to rece=\nnt firing of foreign minister Tanaka and prolonged economic slowdown. USD/J=\nPY support is seen at 132.50, 132.20 and 132.0. Resistance is eyed at 134.0=\n, 134.60 and 135.0.  The pound soared nearly a full cent to a 3-week high o=\nf 1.4346 against the dollar and climbed one-third pence to a 1-week high of=\n .6111 against the euro, cheered by the larger-than-expected surge in UK RP=\nIX to 2.6% y/y in January from the previous 1.9%, thereby breaking above th=\ne Bank of England's 2.5% inflation target. The data suggests that as inflat=\nion rises because of strong domestic consumption, the BoE could begin raisi=\nng interest rates soon since it has the highest rate of growth among all th=\ne G7 nations. Thus markets will be interested in seeing the BoE's quarterly=\n inflation report due tomorrow for clues about its next monetary policy dec=\nision. The BoE Governor George said that January unexpected jump in inflati=\non was likely  erratic  and it should be around 2.5% Bank's ceiling around =\ntwo years. His comments could dampen the market expectations of rate rise. =\nGeorge said that he could not say the rate hike is imminent, but he is prep=\nared to lower rates if needed. George also commented that the euro's levels=\n are puzzlingly weak and he believed the single currency would strengthen i=\nn near future.   EUR/USD is trading around 87.60 underpinned by relief that=\n Germany was not issued a formal warning about its budget deficit at the Eu=\nrozone finance ministers' meeting. Both Germany and Portugal vowed to keep =\ntheir budget deficits below the EU's 3% of GDP limit. Analysts noted that b=\necause of the lack of a reprimand, Germany would not have to slash public s=\npending that would boost growthThe single currency was under slight downwar=\nd pressure from reports that European telecom Carrier 1 was filing for bank=\nruptcy. Upside capped at 88.0, 88.50 and 89.0. Support holds at 87.0, 86.65=\n and 86.40.   Tomorrow's release of US retail sales is expected to show a d=\necline to -0.3% in January from the previous -0.1% due to falling auto sale=\ns. However, retail sales ex-autos are forecasted to rise to 0.4% in January=\n from -0.1% in December helped by strong general merchandise and apparel sa=\nles.  This week's other major US economic releases include retail sales, jo=\nbless claims, business inventories, import prices, PPI, industrial producti=\non and the University of Michigan confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicator=\ns consist of the ECB monthly bulletin, Dutch GDP, French employment, French=\n trade balance, French industrial production and Italian industrial product=\nion. Noteworthy UK data releases are the labor market report and the Bank o=\nf England inflation forecast. Highlights from Japan comprise GDP, balance o=\nf payments, industrial production and Tokyo department store sales.    =09[=\nIMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=\nt=20\nare underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=\nasic=20\norganizational framework has been set.=20\nAs you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=\n=20\nresponsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=\n=20\nJoe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=\n=20\nto Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=\n;=20\nhowever, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20\ncommercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =\nwill=20\nbe on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=\nl=20\ncountry management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=\nO=20\nof Elektro until its ultimate sale.\nThe existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20\nElektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=\n=20\nEnron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=\n=20\nFrevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=\nnd=20\nArgentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=\n=20\nreputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20\nmanaged prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=\ns=20\nare pursued.\nThe remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20\nAmerica will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=\nrk=20\nbusiness model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20\ncommodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=\ne=20\nproducts to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=\n=20\nenjoys high rates of return on invested capital.\nIn the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =\nto=20\nJoe and Orlando:\n=20\nThe Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=\n =20\nfocus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=\n=20\nnatural gas and electricity, with the following goals:\n? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=\n=20\nneeded by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20\ncapabilities;\n? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=\n=20\nvalue chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=\n=20\nopportunity;\n? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=\n=20\nquickly to capitalize;\n? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20\noverall risk of the organization;\n? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=\nca=20\nconsistent with this strategy, and\n? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=\nal=20\nflow.\nThe Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=\nho=20\nwork as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=\n=20\ncapital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=\nn,=20\nfinance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20\nThe Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=\n=20\nteam will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=\n=20\nfor the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=\ns=20\nefforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=\ny=20\ntrading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=\n=20\nfor managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=\n=20\nreporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=\nas=20\nrisk activities.\nThe Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20\nCommercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=\n=20\nwill continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =\n=20\nThe goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=\non=20\nthat is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20\nfunctions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=\nm=20\nand will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20\nHouston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20\nunits have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=\n=20\nwell as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20\ninfrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=\n=20\nin South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.\nThese groups include:\nThe Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20\nmanage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=\n=20\ngovernmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=\n,=20\nin the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20\nfunctioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20\nassume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=\nis=20\ninterim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=\ny=20\nfunction.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20\nShapiro in Enron Government Affairs.\nThe Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=\nhe=20\ninterface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20\ncurrent duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=\nll=20\nalso report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20\nassisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=\n=20\nCuiaba project.\nThe Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=\n=20\nJohn Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=\n=20\nrequirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20\nWholesale Services - Legal Department.\nMiguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20\nTechnology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=\nl=20\nreport to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=\n=20\nfunctions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20\nrelationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=\n=20\nWholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=\n=20\nServices =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.\nThese changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20\nreflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20\nfinancial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20\norganizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20\nregion, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20\naffected will be notified shortly.\n=20\nEnron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20\nbusinesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=\ne=20\nuniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20\nshareholder value.",

Jesus Condensate\nFYI\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tGraham, Charlie  \nSent:\tTuesday, June 19, 2001 2:42 PM\nTo:\tDelaine Kurth (E-mail)\nSubject:\tMt. Jesus Condensate\nDelaine,\nThe Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the condensate removed.\nEffective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.  This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease # 71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.  \nThis location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.  Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.\nThanks\nCharlie\n(402) 398-7061\nNorthern Natural Gas Company\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nShortpay Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMt.

They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll \nback retail power\n  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .\n  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 \ncents per\n  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric \nCo. can be\n  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable \ncosts to that\n  commodity price.\n  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far \nhigher than the\n  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market \nhas been\n  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by \nthe utility from a\n  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, \nrespectively, compared\n  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.\n  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near \nmutiny. The\n  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as \nwell as to\n  schools and hospitals.\n  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by \nthe California\n  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked \n$150 million of\n  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs \nif they greatly\n  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be \nexpected to make\n  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.\n  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric \nCo., said the\n  rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can \nrise but sets\n  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for \ncustomers to pay\n  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until \nDecember 2002 or\n  December 2003.\n  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 \nmillion, provided\n  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices \nthrough\n  December 2002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \n\"creates\n  tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company \nto finance\n  new projects such as a new transmission line.\n  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the \npermit process for the\n  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of \nregulatory agencies that\n  review the plans. \n                                                  \n  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Please send me a copy of the CFTC no action letter that we discussed last \nweek.\n2.  Please prepare a memorandum outlining the issues to be addressed in \nreviewing internally-generated content, e.g. (a) CTA concerns; (b) general \nadvisor issues; (c) other general resposibilities of a publisher, such as \ntruth, accuracy.  (As I mentioned, I think it would be helpful to have some \ngeneral insights from someone with a publishing background.)  Additionally, \nare there any particular issues to be addressed with regard to content \ngenerated by an outside consultant like Cynthia Case who prepares a case \nstudy for EnronOnline containing generic advise and who also provides \nadvisory services to third parties.  \nAs you requested, I am faxing to you a few examples of content that has been \ndeveloped for Phase II to date.  If you run into any red flags, please let me \nknow at your earliest opportunity.  Time is of the essence, and the text that \nI am sending you has already gone out to the site developer for html \nformatting.\n3.  Please review the current Legal and Privacy Information I am forwarding \nto you and revise to incorporate necessary modifications and/or additions.\n4.  Mark and I have discussed the issue of appropriate disclaimers in some \nlength.  Currently, the Legal and Privacy Information link is discretely \ntucked beside the copyright notice on the home page.  We have asked that the \nhome page instead include an addition at the bottom of the text referencing \nLegal and Privacy Information:  \"Please see Legal and Privacy Information \n[link] for terms governing your use of the web site.\"  \nThe home page links to a page entitled \"EnronOnline Markets\", which links to \nvarious commodity \"home\" pages.  On each of the EnronOnline Markets and \ncommodity pages, we would like to add the following text as well:  \"Your \ncompany should not enter into any transaction unless it fully understands the \npotential risks and rewards of that transaction and has independently \ndetermined that the transaction is appropriate in light of your company's \nobjectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and other \nrelevant circumstances.

For further information, please see Legal and Privacy \nInformation [link].\"\nThese additions to the site are pending EnronOnline approval, but I would \nwelcome any general thoughts you may have.\nI am receiving 2-5 pieces of content for review, and after my review, each \npiece of content is forwarding to the site developer for formatting.  As you \ncan appreciate, timing is critical so that we can minimize the required \nreformatting.\nThank you so much for your assistance!\nLeslie Hansen\n(713) 853-6121",

If you wish to unsubscribe\nor change your email address, please follow\nthe instructions at the bottom of this message.\nThe Fed Cut Rates a half-point today.\nIs this just the shock the market needs?\nDear Investor,\nJust when you think the Fed is going to leave us\nanxiously waiting until their planned meeting in\nMay...surprise...they go and cut rates a half-point,\ntoday.  And like most investors you're probably\nwondering: \"Why did the Fed cut now? and \"What will\nthis mean for the market?\"\nTo be honest, I'm a little surprised myself at the\nFed's timing.  They've had plenty of opportunities in\nthe past to cut when the reason seemed crystal clear.\nToday, the only insight we have into why the Fed cut\nis that they saw some compelling economic data that\njustified their action.  And you know what, that's\nreally all they need to tell us.\nNow that a cut's been made the more important story\nhere is what this will mean for the market. While I\nexpect this news to bolster consumer confidence a bit\nand result in a nice short-term rally, I don't believe\nthis half-point cut will spell relief for the entire\nmarket for too long.  Corporate earnings are forecast\nto be down in the next two quarters and that's going\nto take a toll on some of the flagship stocks on Wall\nStreet.\nSo while I think a rally is in store...it's going to be\na selective one.

Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers.\nQ. Why did Enron enter into the deals?\nA. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to \"hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,\" by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies.\nQ. How did those investments do?\nA. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that.\nQ. Why can't that be discerned?\nA. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely.\nQ. Why were they so complicated?\nA. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back - whether for $1 or $50 - there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule.\nQ. Who made money from these transactions?\nA. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors.\nQ. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?\nA. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important.\nQ. When were concerns raised with Enron?\nA. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships.\nQ. How did Enron do?\nA. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\nQ. How did that happen?\nA. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated \"previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.\" Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings.\nQ. Is that legal under the accounting rules?\nA. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS",

There can be no argument about\nthis.  Since Enron is holding Mitsubishi fully liable for the contamination\naccording to the terms and conditions of the relevant charterparty, Enron \ntakes\nthe view that it does not have a liability to pay either the freight or\ndemurrage.  Should Mitsubishi disagree, Enron suggests that all disputes are\nreferred to arbitration pursuant to the relevant clause of C/P.  Enron will\nalmost certainly be commencing arbitration once the joint analysis results are\nknown in order to recover their losses which have not yet been fully \nquantified.\nWe respectfully suggest that Mitsubishi reviews its entitlement to freight and\ndemurrage after the joint testing\".\nI have since looked at the charterparty for the second leg sent to me \nyesterday.\nIt is quite clear that we freely agreed to enter into an extended C/P for the\nsecond voyage on 19 July having agreed firstly to pay freight for the first\nvoyage (which has now been done) and secondly to pay estimated demurrage on \nthe\nfirst voyage to be paid \"by charterers as quickly as possible against owners'\nprovisional invoice, also actual demurrage amount to be settled by charterers \nas\nsoon as possible\".\nIn my view, therefore, we cannot succesfully resist an application for an\ninterim award both for freight and demurrage.  We can counterclaim back \ndamages\nfor paid freight and demurrage assuming we are successful at a later stage in\nproving breach by Mitsubishi of the Charterparty concerning the contaminated\ncargo.\nPlease confirm that the cargo owner and charterer are one and the same, i.e.\nEnron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore Pte Limited.  This appears to be the\ncase since the charterers are ECTRS and I note the manuscript entry on the \nfirst\npage of the liquid fuel purchase contract recording an assignment of the\ncontract from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp to ECTRS.\nRegards\nDavid Best\n__________________________\nThis e-mail and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended\nsolely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.\nAny views or opinions expressed within this e-mail are those of the author and\ndo not necessarily represent those of Clyde & Co.

        "original_email": "Date: Fri, 14 Jun 2002 10:02:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: veronica.davies@enron.com\nTo: ge_benefits@enron.com\nSubject: GEWE PIA's\nBody: \nCc: michael.barnas@ps.ge.com, colleen.repplier@ps.ge.com\nBcc: michael.barnas@ps.ge.com, colleen.repplier@ps.ge.com\nAfternoon All,\nNEW PIAs\nI know many of you have been very anxious to get your arms around a new GE \nconfidentiality agreement.  I am attaching the following:\n1.  Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement.  This is to be used with clients for \npotential transactions and for the exchange of information where the third \nparty will not be designing a product and where we do not expect to own that \ndesign.\n2.  Proprietary Rights and Nondisclosure Agreement.  This is to be used with \nengineers and vendors where they will be producing product for us that we \nconsider to be GE Wind work product.  For example, if we engage an engineer \nto design something for us where we expect to own that design.\nFILLING THEM OUT\nIt is very important that the PIAs be properly completed.  For the most part \nthat just means filling in the third parties name in the first paragraph and \nin the signature block.  However, there is one important variation with the \nMutual Nondisclosure Agreement, you are required to fill in a description of \nthe transaction that you are working on with the third party. \nExamples:\nmanufacture and procurement of main shafts\nsale of GE wind turbines to the Company\ngeneral development opportunities with the Company using GE wind turbines\nsale of GE wind turbines to the Company for XYZ Project\nIMPORTANT DIFFERENCES FROM EWC'S FORM\nPlease keep in mind that the GE form requires you to follow up with a written \nletter as to any verbal conversation you had with someone where you discussed \nconfidential information or you took someone on a visual site tour.  So if \nyou discuss something about our turbines that if put in writing we would \nconsider confidential, you must send a quick letter following up that \nconversation and notifying them that the information is subject to this \nagreement.  Also, if you take someone on a site tour where they are privy to \nconfidential information, you must follow up with a letter.   I will come up \nwith a basic letter that you can keep and fill in the blanks and send out \nwhenever the situation arises.  Please keep in mind that these agreements are \nonly as good as the documentation that backs them so be diligent in your \nefforts.  \nLEGAL REVIEW OF PIAs/ GETTING YOUR PIA SIGNED\nIf you do not make any changes to the text of the PIA, you do not need to \nseek legal review prior to having it signed by GE Wind Energy LLC.  GE Wind \nis still working on signing authority and we should have further clarity \nsoon.  Until then, all persons who were vice-presidents of EWC are able to \nsign PIAs.  Of course, Colleen Repplier can also sign.  For your convenience, \nhere are a list of the most likely signatories in the U.S.:\nBob Gates\nMichael Miller\nBob Rugh\nCraig Christenson\nMichael Westbeld\nBen Bell\nJeff Maurer\nWHAT TO DO WITH YOUR SIGNED PIAs\n1.  Please send a signed copy to Maya Arthur who will scan the PIA onto the \nsystem and maintain a data bank of PIAs that everyone can access.   This will \navoid the situation where we don't know if a customer or vendor has signed \none yet or not.  I believe once we have acess to the GE network, we can post \nthese directly on the system.\n2.  Send the original to legal.\nWHAT ABOUT THE PIAs SIGNED WITH EWC\nWe did our best to find and assign all PIAs that were signed with EWC.  \nHowever, many are old and frankly, it just makes sense going forward to sign \nup new PIAs.  This avoids a situation where you are banking on a previously \nsigned PIA that fell threw the cracks and wasn't assigned.  I would recommend \nthat you starting signing up new PIAs as you go.\nQUESTIONS\nGive me a call.  V.",

Currently, Blanco is an \nactive pool facility that is traded by the West desk.  In order to allow the \nDeal Confirmations group to identify which trades require special handling \nlanguage in the confirm, we have all decided to create a second meter with \nthe same data reference number in Global Facilities.  Doing this will serve \nthree purposes.  First of all, creating a second meter on the same data \nreference number allows users to see two separate meters in Sitara without \naffecting the way that physical location is nominated to the pipe since all \nthey receive is the data reference number.  The change will also allow the \nProduct Controls Group to create multiple products in EOL with different \npricing terms on the same physical point.  In addition, it will temporarily \nresolve the issue the Deal Confirmation is currently experiencing in \nsegregating the confirmations that need special language.    I will be \ncreating a portfolio that will include all new trades done at both BLANCO \nmeters which will be monitored by the Deal Confirmation group.  I will make \nsure to contact all of you once the meter change has become effective.  When \nthe change is completed, expect to see the following locations available for \nselection in Sitara.\nPipe Zone  Meter   Product Description\nEPNG BLANCO BLANCO EP Blanco 100%; use the standard Delivery Location field \nand add flag \"Special Handling - 2 Nomination Cycle       language\". \nEPNG BLANCO AVGBLANCO RESTRICTED, use the standard Delivery Location field \nand add flag \"Special Handling - Operational Constraints       language\".\nPlease call me if you have any questions.  \nImelda Frayre\nx35423\n ",

He\nloves the mountains and  \nrivers and prairies that stretch into forever in\nWyoming.? He is of the  \nAmerican West.? His handshake is firm.? He looks you\nin the  \neye.? His word is his bond.? He is a world class listener, and  \nwhen\nhe talks, it is always worth listening.? I have never known a wiser  \nman.\nTo my three daughters, he is &quot;Papa.&quot;? Watching him with  \nhis granddaughters\nis a great joy.?? My daughters are young and  \ntheir concerns are the concerns\nof little girls -- dolls and play-dough and  \nfirst friends.? He has infinite\ntime for them, as he always has for my  \nsister and me.? He is never rushed,\nnever hurried.? He is supremely  \nkind, loving and patient - listening to\ntheir latest song from school,  \nreading bedtime stories, or teaching them how\nto fish (a lesson Cheneys learn  \nearly). \nHe grew up in Casper, Wyoming in the days when you could ride your  \nbike out\nof town and hunt rabbits on the prairie.? His dad, a World War  \nII veteran,\nwas a career civil servant with the Soil Conservation  \nService.? His mom\nworked as a secretary at Bustard's Funeral Home to  \nmake ends meet.? He\npitched for the local American Legion baseball  \nteam.? He owed much of his\nskill to my grandmother, who had played for  \nthe Syracuse, Nebraska\nBluebirds, a nationally-ranked girls' softball  \nteam.? She caught his pitches\nmany evenings on their front lawn at 505  \nTexas Place.\nHe was the first in his family to graduate from college.?  \nHe built\npowerlines across Wyoming and Colorado to help pay his way.? He  \ncarried a\nticket for six years in the International Brotherhood of Electrical  \nWorkers.\nHe married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, in  \n1964.?? One look at the\ninscriptions they penned in each other's  \nhigh school yearbooks and you know\nthey were as deeply in love at 18 as they  \nare today.? He was the captain of\nthe football team and she was the  \nhomecoming queen.? Getting her elected was\nhis first political  \ncampaign.\nThere have been lots of other campaigns since then.? Despite  \nhis success,\nhe's not a typical politician.? He's not a  \nglad-hander.? He's not a\nfast-talker.? He's not slick.? He is  \nwho he is.? He is real and honest and\ntrue.? \nHe loves this  \ncountry.? He knows how blessed we all are to be Americans.?  \nHe\ntaught my sister and me that we owe everything we have to the brave men  \nand\nwomen who died so that we could be free.? When we were young, he  \ntook us to\nthe battlefields where the Civil War was fought.? He taught  \nus to love\nhistory and to revere this great nation.???  \nServing as Secretary of Defense was the greatest honor of his life.? I  \nhave\nheard him say that this was because of the troops, the men and women of  \nthe\nU.S. military.? I went with him to Arlington National Cemetery the  \nday of\nthe memorial service for the servicemen and women who died in the  \nPersian\nGulf War.?? I stood next to him in the amphitheater with  \nthe families who\nhad lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, watching as  \nthe military\njets flew overhead in the missing man formation.? It was  \nthe first time I\never saw tears in his eyes. \nThere are cynics today who  \nwould have us believe that no politician is a man\nof honor.? Maybe the  \nlast eight years have done this to us.? I hope not.\nThere are good  \npeople in American politics today; honorable and wise people,\npeople who keep  \ntheir word and inspire us to live lives of goodness and\ntruth.? There  \nare leaders among us.? \nIn Governor Bush and my father, America has the  \nchance to vote for two of\nthese men this Election Day. \nLiz Cheney Perry  ",

Except Utah, which\n> she does not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP\n> for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a\n> world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without\n> the need for further elections.  Congress and the Senate will be\n> disbanded.  A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine\n> whether any of you noticed.\n> To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following\n> rules are introduced with immediate effect:\n> 1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.\n> Then look up \"aluminium\".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be\n> amazed at just how wrong you have been pronouncing it.  Generally, you\n> should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up \"vocabulary\".\n> Using the same twenty seven words  interspersed with filler noises such as\n> \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of\n> communication.  Look up \"interspersed\".\n> 2. There is no such thing as \"US English\".  We will let Microsoft know\n> on your behalf.\n> 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.\n> It\n> really isn't that hard.\n>\n> 4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as\n> the good guys.\n> 5. You should relearn your original national anthem, \"God Save The\n> Queen\", but only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you\n> to get confused and give up half way through.\n> 6. You should stop playing American \"football\".  There is only one kind\n> of football.  What you refer to as American \"football\" is not a very good\n> game.\n> The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders\n> may have noticed that no one else plays  \"American\" football.  You will no\n> longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.\n> Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.  It is a\n> difficult game.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to\n> play rugby (which is similar to American \"football\", but does not involve\n> stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body\n> armour like nancies).  We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby\n> sevens side by 2005.\n> 7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons\n> if they give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware that\n> there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.  The\n> Russians have never been the bad guys.  \"Merde\" is French for \"sh*t\".\n> 8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new\n> national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called \"Indecisive\n> Day\".\n> 9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for\n> your own good.

In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.

Heat \nwave is\n  expected to continue today. \n  NANCY RIVERA BROOKS \n    \n  09/19/2000 \n  Los Angeles Times \n  Home Edition \n  Page C-1 \n  Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company \n  Sweltering weather across California pushed the state's heat-stressed \nelectricity grid close\n  to meltdown Monday, and state power officials urged electricity \nconservation because today\n  and Wednesday could be even worse.\n  Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125,000 \nresidential and\n  business air-conditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after \nthe California\n  Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid for about 75% \nof the state,\n  declared a Stage 2 power emergency. At Stage 2, when the grid is using more \nthan 95% of\n  available power, the state's big investor-owned utilities are asked to \ninterrupt power to\n  customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for \ndiscounted rates.\n  Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern \nCalifornia stopped\n  working for a time as heavy air-conditioner demand began to push power use \nhigher,\n  Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.\n  Demand peaked at about 42,000 megawatts on the Cal-ISO grid, but the two \nunidentified\n  units, representing about 320 megawatts of generation, were returned to \nservice in the\n  afternoon--in time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3, \nwhich would lead to\n  neighborhood blackouts.\n  \"We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3,\" McCorkle \nsaid. \"A couple\n  of generators fell offline in late morning, and that kind of gave everybody \na scare.\"\n  A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 1.5%--in \nessence,\n  when the electricity grid is using more than 98.5% of available power--and \nrotating outages\n  of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep \nthe grid from\n  failing. That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours.\n  Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles \nDepartment of Water\n  and Power, peaking near 4,750 megawatts Monday. But DWP customers were not\n  threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the \nmunicipal utility has\n  more than enough generating capacity to meet demand.\n  \"We're doing OK as we have all summer long,\" said DWP General Manager S. \nDavid\n  Freeman.\n  Cal-ISO asked Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San \nDiego Gas &\n  Electric to call on all of their interruptible-power customers to \nimmediately stop using\n  electricity, representing a potential 3,000 megawatts, or roughly the \namount of electricity\n  used by 3 million homes.\n  Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the \nCalifornia\n  equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about 1:30 \np.m, the\n  seventh time this year, college spokesman Sue Bozman said. If the college \ndoesn't pull the\n  plug, it pays a big fine.\n  \"For several years, we saved $100,000 a year by being on this \ninterruptible-service plan,\"\n  said Bozman, who with other administrators finished the work day with \nmobile phones and\n  portable computers. \"But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off \nour power, it's a\n  whole different ballgame.\"\n  One such day in May, during final exams, the college didn't cut power and \npenalties totaled\n  $30,000, she said.\n  During the height of Monday's power crisis, PG&E--whose territory suffered \nlocal blackouts\n  on June 14 in a similar reliability emergency--kept an open telephone line \nto Cal-ISO for\n  minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said.\n  SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity \nas possible, and\n  grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other \npower use to comply.\n  \"We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take \nseriously,\" Pam Bass,\n  SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as \nelectricity use\n  soared Monday. \"If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be \ndirected by\n  the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone \nneeds to cut their\n  use of power now to avoid forced outages.\"\n  Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting \npeak use of\n  44,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 44,537 megawatts \non\n  Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total \nlower.\n  \"We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today,\" SCE \nspokeswoman Karen\n  Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at \n17,860\n  megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut \n2,500\n  megawatts of electricity. \"It got really touchy today,\" she said.\n  *\n  Times staff writer Zanto Peabody contributed to this report. \n                                                  \n  Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If \nyou would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact \nthem, just let me know.\nAndy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management \npractice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client \nrelated), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit \nand the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  \nI have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend \nhim to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to \ntravelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not \ninterested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 \n0040.\nMark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in \nHouston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for \nCoral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for \n15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, \nproducts trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery \nitself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are \nextremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly \nrecommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and \nhe is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  \nHis cell phone number is 713 412 3890.\nAlan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works \nwith my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find \nopportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 \n2000).\nMarilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of \naccounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and \nall mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all \nproducts).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  \nShe was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely \ndiligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have \nto say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a \nclient/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at \nthe alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year \nas she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to \nme that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, \nand has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that \nshe is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 \n277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it \ndue to the PwC/alliance relationship.\nRebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a \nyear, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit \nmanager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very \nconscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! \n(713 230 3000 general line).\nKim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred \nover from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing \nwhat she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her \nat the general AA line.\nKevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not \nknow him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the \naudit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).\nKeith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best \nsenior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have \never worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of \nwork experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked \nfor me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent \nevaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of \nthe best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working \non a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office \nprocesses .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of \nPwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to \nmanager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 \nthis year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will \nbe approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to \ncontinue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith \nto elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His \nnumber is 713 356 5617.\nDave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting \nand has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving \nKoch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a \ngood guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be \nreachable through the general number for Koch.\nAdmin assistants\nConnie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative \nassistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for \nPwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in \nEnron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not \nworked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked \nto her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC \nnumber).\nEllen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave \nPwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on \nhow she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).",

We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.\n \nWe know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.\n \nThe committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.\n \nThe Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!\n \nWhen we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.\n \nWe now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.\n \nWe remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.\n \nWith respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.\n \nIn the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.\n \nAnd of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.",

I also wanted to make sure that US Windpower is not affiliated \nwith Enron Wind.  Essentially, we would be representing a court appointed \ntrustee sought by a number of project lenders that desire to cause the sale \nof an independent wind power facility since those lenders have not been \npaid.  I assume that the lenders have not been paid since PG&E has failed to \nmake power purchase payments to the project owner.  My understanding is that \nwe would only become involved if the lender group is successful in having a \ntrustee appointed and that we would not be involved in any dispute or \nproceedings relating to the appointment of the trustee.  We would handle the \ntransactional work resulting from the sale of the project to a third party \nbuyer.  At this point, I would not see us handling any litigation against \nPG&E.  I would circle back with you first if we were asked to do this to make \nsure that, at such time,  it did not create any problems.  Could you let me \nknow whether you have any concerns with this representation?  As usual, \nthanks for your consideration.

YOUNG\" <BYOUNG@LLGM.COM>\nTo: \"JOHN G KLAUBERG\" <JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM>\nSubject: US Windpower\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nJohn,\nAs we discussed, we have been asked to represent Susan Uecker as the proposed \nreceiver for Windpower Partners 1989 Limited Partnership, a California \nlimited partnership.  Windpower Partners operates a windpower electrical \ngeneration facility in Altamont Pass, California.  The general partner of \nWindpower Partners is US Windpower, Inc.  The plant is operated by FORAS \nService Corporation.  As far as I can tell, US Windpower is not an Enron \nentity.\nThe project lenders are State Street Bank as indenture trustee for Household \nCommercial; John Hancock Mutual Insurance; Cigna; Connecticut General; Life \nInsurance Co. of North America; Ohio National Life Assurance; and Southern \nFarm Bureau Annuity.  I understand that the lenders are owed $40 million.\nAs I understand it, the lenders want to have a receiver appointed for the \nproject, with the receiver directed to sell the project.  A receiver takes \npossession of property on behalf of the Court and holds it subject to the \nCourt's direction.  The receiver is, and must remain, a neutral party.  The \nreceiver is entitled to retain counsel, with counsel paid out of the \nreceivership assets.  I frequently represent Ms. Uecker in these kinds of \nmatters, and was told that the lenders encouraged her to retain us in this \nmatter.\nIn California, to appoint a receiver, the lender sues the borrower and files \na motion to have the Court appoint a receiver.  Thus, the lender and borrower \nlitigate the issue of whether a receiver should be appointed, and the \nreceiver does not get involved unless and until the Court has ruled in the \nlenders' favor.\nAs I understand it, the lenders want the receiver to market the project.  \nThus our role would be to (i) make sure the receiver remains neutral, and \n(ii) to handle documenting and closing the sale.  I would not anticipate any \nsignificant litigation with the borrower or the lenders, unless the borrower \nrefused to comply with the Court's order directing it to turnover possession \nof property to the receiver.\nThe borrower undoubtedly is a creditor of PG&E.  I was told that the lenders \ndo not want the receiver to go after PGE at this time, but view that as an \nissue for the buyer.\nPlease let me know if you have any concerns with us undertaking this \nrepresentation.\nBen Young",

Seab said that they are not set up to do a detailed modeling analysis, but that Tabors has the programs already set up and could probably do some type of a modeling analysis.  However, we discussed what other type of study we could do, and we came up with a few ideas.\nSeab said that there are general benefits to RTO formation:  e.g., transmission expansion (although you still have siting problems, RTOs will build new transmission where it is needed); administrative cost savings; savings from reserve sharing.  We also discussed the arguments of the cheap power states.  For example, many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power.  But Seab points out that RTOs do not mean that the states \"lose\" their low cost power.  The PSCs retain their authority to decide whether their utilities can or cannot sell power from their plants to third parties.  The PSCs can prohibit utilities from exporting low cost power if it is needed to serve local retail customers.  Seab thought this response to a potential \"cost\" of RTOs could also be worked into the analysis.\nSeab and Kevin are going to give the issue more thought and put together a proposal.  The problem is timing.  Seab has California testimony due on November 6 and he expects to be tied up with that for the next 2 weeks.  If we use the cost/benefit study as part of our NOPR comments (due end of Nov - mid Dec), then he will have enough time.  If we want to present a study before that time (perhaps with comments on RTO week), he will not be able to do the work.  Seab will have a proposal by COB tomorrow or perhaps Monday morning.\nI have a call in to Tabors to discuss the same proposal with him.\nLarry Ruff is on vacation this week.  He's back on Monday.  We can call him then.\nRick, you also named a few other people:  Charles Stallon, Eric Wolchek, the Brattle Group.  Should I put calls in to these people as well?  Let me know.\nSarah\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tShapiro, Richard  \nSent:\tThursday, October 11, 2001 1:05 PM\nTo:\tNovosel, Sarah; Steffes, James D.\nSubject:\tFW: RTO case studies and analysis\nWhere are we on getting our study jumpstarted?

I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk\n   Holding's\n   unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk\n   Energy\n   Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to\n   close\n   in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale\n   of\n   Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business\n   units may\n   occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing\n   other\n   career opportunities.\n        I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron\n   because of\n   my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General\n   Counsel\n   for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior\n   management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and\n   the\n   energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and\n   negotiating\n   gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and\n   related\n   documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions,\n   including\n   physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor\n   and I\n   am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory\n   proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in\n   the\n   energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory\n   proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related\n   energy\n   industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy\n   Marketers\n   Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also\n   responsible for\n   representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and\n   alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes\n   utility\n   regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with\n   corporate\n   mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee\n   issues,\n   interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and\n   secured\n   transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation\n   and real\n   property matters.\n        I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at\n   your\n   earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing\n   from\n   you soon.\n        Thank you for your consideration.\n                            Very truly yours,\n                            Steven R.

It didn't rain, thunder, sprinkle shoot it wasn't even\nhumid or misty!  I got screwed!  :)  Ok it wasn't all that bad.  I actually\nhad a really great time.  Imagine someone actually going on vacation to see\nit pour rain.  Sick sick individual!\nLet's see the first day all we did was tour the city and allow lil' miss\nNikki to be a spy!  Portland was great no wonder you live in the middle of\ndown town.  There were so many things to do and see!  Unfortunately because\nwe didn't exactly have a good idea of where to go and so on and so forth we\njust wondered around aimlessly.\nThen on Saturday we all drove to Astoria...you knew I just had to go!!  It\nwas great!  Absolutely beautiful!  On the way we stopped at the fresh berry\nmarket and had the most amazing berries!!! Oh they were good!  Next we ate\nat a little fish place mmmm...clam chowder and fried seafood.  Then went to\nCannon Beach.  What a great little town!  I bought some pulled taffy and\nsome hot chocolate and was in heaven!  Alot of the beach sites , (for\nexample Haystack rock) were in the Goonies film.  Then of course I found the\nlittle hotel that \"Kindergarten Cop\" was filmed in.  what a loser I was\ntaking pictures like a fool!\nBill you don't understand, for years and years every Saturday after cartoons\nI would pop \"KC\" into the VCR.  I loved it! Ok ok dorky but hey you have to\nhave some abnormalities in your life.\nThen if you haven't been here I am going to be the one to take you for your\nfirst time....if you'll let me.  And hey don't get any wild hairs about\nexploring this before hand mister!!!I'm the tour guide on this baby!!! :)\nIt's outside of Cannon Beach just past Hug point.  It's a little trek called\nFalcon Cove.  you can reach the beach and it is the most beautiful hike we\nwent on.\nFinally we drove back into town and ate at the most discusting little dive\ndowntown!  Bush Gardens????  Blech!  Horrible I felt like I had licked the\nhair on my dogs butt!  Oooo it was just gross.\nThen of course I got to meet you.  That was a nice highlight to my trip.\nYou rate right up there along side the \"KC\" hotel rooms.  yeah I kinda like\nya!  :)\nNext morning I ate the best breakfast of my entire life.  Not kidding!  It's\nsomething like the Otwalia???  It's in the Westin hotel.  Ok we all shared\nour plates so this was our breakfasts...Sarah got a fruit plate, I got eggs\nbenedict and Todd got pecan encrusted french toast with orange zing butter\nand syrup.  Swear to God that is the first place I want to go to eat when I\nget to go back.  Ok it was a little pricey though.  Not tooo bad.  it was\n31.25 for 3 of us.  Not alot but breakfast is usually like 5 bucks!\nThe next two days were spent in Hood River/ Cascade Lockes.  We hiked the\nMananomah (whatever) falls the next day we rented bikes and rode them around\nthe town of Stevens,WA.  15 miles!  I was really hurting by that night! 3/4\nof the trail was up hill!  Oh my tail end hurt like crazy!  In Steven's we\nate at a little snack shop.  It was probably one of the better places!  Oh\nwhat was it's name???  Oh Little Viking's.  Really cute place.  You've gotta\ngo!  Oh one more that I won't recommend...Tugboat Annie's in Hood River.\nAgain I felt like I had given an ATB to someone!  Too fancy.  I'm a meat and\npotatoe girl.  That fancy stuff is nice sometimes but usually they just over\ndo it.\nWE ate at Stanford's the last day and it was another fancy place.  I ordered\nonion rings and they were good.  The salad was horrible!  So on a food\nrating scale POrtland/Oregon recieves a 70%.  I guess I'm just not going to\nthe right places.\nAs you can tell by the length of this I am at work and needing to use some\nof my time up!  You are the poor sap I've chosen since you don't know me\nyet.\nWell the move out date is set for me.  I move out on July 31.  I'm not too\nsure when the townhouse will be available though so I'm playing it by ear.\nDO you have any idea when your trip out there might fall?  If you have a\nball park idea that might be nice until you get concrete dates.  I just want\nto be sure that I'm off of work as much as possible the day or days that you\nhave elected to spend with me.  That is if you still want to spend them with\nme.  I mean I did sort of stalk your house and found out where you\nlived....that can't be good! :)\nOk I honestly and sincerely feel bad about that whole situation.  I'm just\nsort of a small town girl who knows that those things really aren't\nappropriate but do them regardless.  You'll understand once we become better\nfriends!  I warned you a little though.  I did say that I was spontaneous\nand might just show up on your doorstep.  Well there you go I did!\nPlease don't tell Brendan.  You probably already did!  I actually need to\nE-mail him and tell him what a sweetheart he is for introducing me to you.\nThe small amount of time I got to spend with you was very nice.  I look\nforward to doing that again sometime.  We'll just up hte time slot a hair.\nOk I will let your weary eyes seetle back to work.  Oh I did receive your\nvoicemail on my phone but it was in NM.  I wouldn't have had time anyhow but\nthank you for your hospitality and the offer.  I can't wait to reciprocate\nit in CAli.!\nTake care,\nNikki\n_______________________________________________________\nSend a cool gift with your E-Card\nhttp://www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/",

However, I do not have anything on the service side.

We are trying to improve the language relating to the termination payment (Section 5.4) in the bandwidth trading master.  The old version had a very complicated and repetitive formula that tried to reflect replacement costs but in practice did not do so (I will not go into why here).  Based on some ISDA materials sent to me by Elizabeth Sager, as well as the benefit of the trading forms in some of our other businesses, we have come up with the  attached.  I would be so grateful if you could give me some feedback on this 5.4 as soon as you can because we are a bit strapped in producing agreements.  \nAs I mentioned to Mark on the phone today, I am also trying to work out how critical is the provision allowing for payment by the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party.  As we know, most of the time a non-defaulting party would not elect to terminate if they thought they were going to have to make a payment, but given our strictly physical, not overly liquid market at the moment, this provision has the old time telecoms companies with their eyeballs swivelling around in their sockets (of course the agreement as a whole is a bit of a shock to them, but this seems to be the provision they cannot get their brains around).  Although I am not necessarily suggesting we take this feature out of the form, I would just like your thoghts on whether we have any flexibility to delete it where necessary.\nFinally, I note that our form does not have any provision to suspend delivery if the buyer is not paying.  Again, given the physical delivery character of this market, I would recommend we add such a feature.\nI will anxiously await your feedback...And again, many thanks.  \n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tWilson, Pauline  \nSent:\t09 August 2001 10:32\nTo:\tVickerman, James\nCc:\tBrowning, Mary Nell\nSubject:\tMaster Agreement - Form\nJames, \nHere is the Master Agreement - Form.

Sources \nalso say it may be a signal that there is a majority on his committee that \nwould support some kind of legislative control on the wholesale power market \nin the West.\n\"I am issuing an admonition to the financial community,\" Murkowski said at \nthe conclusion of a hearing on the recent FERC order. \"If the financial \ncommunity will come in and say what terms and conditions they will need to \nbring new generation into the state, we can cut through this chatter.\"\nAmong other provisions, the FERC order institutes a plan for price controls \nduring Stage 1 and higher power emergencies. Lawmakers at the hearing, \nespecially from California and the West, criticized the action as \ninsufficient to prevent price gouging.\nFERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the limited nature of the price controls will \ncontinue to provide the power industry with incentives to build power plants \nin California.\nMurkowski called on financial interests attending the hearing to settle the \ndebate.\n\"Tells us what you will or will not do under a price cap,\" said Murkowski. \nMurkowski indicated that the answer to his question should come directly from \ntop figures in the financial community. \nMurkowski also signaled that Congress may step in and take legislative action \non the California crisis. \n\"We have to question the adequacy of the order and introduce legislation to \naddress problems if necessary,\" Murkowski said.\nThe sentiment was echoed by other members of the Committee. \n\"We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawed \nand easily manipulated power market wreak havoc on our economy,\" Sen. Maria \nCantwell told Hebert. \"If you're not going to take action, Congress is going \nto act.\"\nAll three FERC commissioners testified at the hearing but it was Chairman \nCurt Hebert who was on the receiving end of most of the criticism.\n\"FERC has done a wonderful imitation of a potted plant,\" Sen. Byron Dorgan \n(D-ND) told Hebert. \"Regulation is not a four letter word. The market system \nsometimes gets out of wack.\nCommissioner William Massey also criticized FERC's order, and acted as \ncounterpoint to Hebert throughout the hearing. Commissioner Linda Breathitt \ndefended her support of the April 26 order.\n\"One thing is clear, you all don't get along very well,\" observed Dorgan.\n\"I'm amazed at what's been done,\" said Murkowski in defending FERC's action \nover the past several weeks. \"It's better than nothing.\"\n\"I've been disappointed,\" replied Dorgan. \"I hope FERC decides it's a \nregulatory body and steps up and takes some action.\"\nSen. Feinstein suggested to Hebert that FERC take a closer look at the impact \nof skyrocketing natural gas prices on the exorbitant increase in electricity \nprices in California.\nIn response, Hebert announced that FERC was holding a technical conference \nMay 24 on current and projected natural gas pipelines into California.\n\"I agree that this is a natural gas situation and we intend to look into this \nas well,\" Hebert said.\nSource: EnergyWashington.com\nDate: May 4, 2001 \n, Inside Washington Publishers",

I would see this as one of the \nessential elements of market design.  I've always felt that the \nphysical/financial distinction was slightly artificial because even with \n\"physical\" contracts, power systems must have a means for cash settlement of \nimbalances (in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to \ncontract volumes).  However, the paper does not really pick this up and in \nsection 3.1 implies that cash settlement might only be \"feasible\" in some \nmarket structures.  I would have added imbalance settlement to section 2.1 \nwhich describes the fundamentals required for any market.  It would also help \nto draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement.\nAt the same time I would have dropped the mention of \"binding market rules\" \nfrom 2.1.  I'd see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the \noperation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental \nprinciple.  It's also not made clear in what sense these commitments are \nbinding.  Are they binding in a financial sense (in which case they are \ncovered by imbalance settlement) or somehow physically (either this is \nunfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty \nwhich is ruled out later in the paper).\nI felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMP's/transmission \nrights with other non-locational elements of market design, this makes it \ndifficult to follow in places.  It would be clearer to have the locational \nelements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles.\nCentralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed.  \nAs Nick hints at below, we wouldn't see this as an essential element of \nmarket design.  Under NETA, individual participants commit their own units \nwith the SO only taking over full control at 3.5 hours out.  Even with \ncentralised commitment, I'm not convinced that simple bidding would be \nsuperior to multi-part bids.  Much here depends on timescales, eg, a \nday-ahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc \nthan a continuous hourly market with simple bids.  Simple bidding was often \nproposed for the Pool, but I think a single daily big would have increased \nprices if two-shifting generators had not been able to reflect their start-up \nand no-load costs separately.  (These elements were also gamed, although this \ngame eroded as competition increased.)\nSpecific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper:\n? we've consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside \npositions.  Publicly we've argued that the proposals do not provide good \neconomic signals over sufficiently long time-periods to enhance allocative \nefficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency \ngains (constraints only cost about o20m pa here).  Despite arguing our \ncommercial position, I'm quite happy with this approach and am genuinely \nsceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK.  This position \nwould of course change in much larger, sparse and less-interconnected \nnetworks such as exist in parts of the US.\n? Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must \npreserve pre-existing implied rights for generators, ie, grandfathering.  I \nrecognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with \nimcumbent market power, but I don't think that this is as big an issue in the \nUK (where competition already exists) as it is on the Contintent and in the \nUS.\nHope these help, let me know if you want to discuss further.\nPaul\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom:  Elms, Nick  \nSent: 22 May 2001 14:29\nTo: Dawson, Paul\nSubject: Frontier Economics' Whitepaper\nPaul,\nHere's some comments on Frontier's whitepaper. Do you want to discuss them? \nSection 3.1\nThe distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is \nblurred. Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification \nto Elexon. Even then a party doesn't need to deliver on the contract - it \ncould cash out at the imbalance price. However, in practice NETA is more \nsimilar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties \ntry to avoid imbalances. \nSection 4.1.1\nDecentralised commitment doesn't require parties to trade physical \ntransmission contracts.  LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment.  It \nis difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading \nunless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates.  \nSimplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs.\nInterim model (section 5)\n1) It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of \njurisdictions in the US - because of the private stakes in the industry.\n2) The proposed day-ahead market need not be run by the ISO.  It's not a unit \ncommitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment, and even if \nit did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading.  Rather, day-ahead \ntrading could be left to the market to develop.  Generators would self commit \nbased on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties \ncould hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading.  These \nday-ahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs - leaving parties \nwith basis risk between the hub and their location.  Parties require some \nmeans of heging the basis risk - financial transmission rights is a \npossibility.\nCompetitive framework (section 6)\n1) Demand side response reduces generators' market power.  Forward \ncontracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and \nconsumers, particularly the impact of short term market power. This may be an \nargument for using HHIs to measure market power.\n2) A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supply/demand \nimbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk.  And it may deter new \nentrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising.\n3) With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers' \nforward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs \nto customers.  Non-eligible customers create a problem.  What price should \nthese customers pay?  It is difficult to regulate a supplier's contracts and \nto somehow split its contract costs between eligible and non-eligible \ncustomers.  This is why a spot price pass-through is suggested.  Financial \ninstitutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers. Those \ninstitutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators.  An \nalternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of non-eligible customers.  \nTo avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the \nsupplier's downside and upside risk.\nNick ",

I would say to just use the one posted now would be the best\nthing to do.\nI did not know who would need to see the policy at your company so I sent\nthe following email to Michael Jacobson at your company.  If there is\nanything further I can do for you feel free to let me know.\n Michael,\nIf you are not the proper person to receive this request will you please\nforward it to the proper person within your organization.  \nWe have recently made significant changes to our credit policy and we have\nrequested all customers be compliant with the credit policy by December 15\nof this year.  I have attached a copy of the credit policy reflecting these\nchanges for your review.  \nAfter reviewing your company's last 24 calendar months of activity it would\nappear that we will need a letter of credit in the amount of at least\n$100,000 for you to be compliant with the terms of the policy.  Approved\nlanguage for the letter of credit is at the end of the credit policy as\nattachment 2.  The issuing bank must also be acceptable to SPP and these\nrequirements can be located in the financial security section of the policy\nunder Letter of Credit.  Also, we have mailed and emailed the policy with a\nrequest to send back the credit agreement.  I have also attached a copy of\nthis agreement.  If you would have it signed and sent back as well it would\nbe greatly appreciated.\n <<Form-SPPCreditPolicy2CS111401.doc>>  <<SPPCreditAgreement110101.doc>> \nPhil McCraw\nSouthwest Power Pool\nFinancial Coordinator\nPhone: 501-664-0146X243 or 501-614-3243\nFax: 501-280-9446\nEmail: pmccraw@spp.org",

I think you and Rick need to chair the meeting\nbecause you will lend credibility and importance to the issue. You may even\nwant to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss(or his designee) to sit in to\nemphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear \"Enron has plenty\nof money\" and \"Thats why we have lawyers\" -the truth being we are the\nguardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility\nto protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, the\nstockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that we\ndo a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety and\nConstruction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checks\nregardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of\nthe employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions\neffecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail to\nact prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a\npenalty. The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of\nthe companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I would\ntake with these people. The Weigle case does not need to be looked at like\nit only cost us $490.00. This continued reckless disregard we have in our\ndecision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we will\nreplace Foster Wheeler's Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement as\nsomething the EPC Industry talks about. I may be overreacting here but I've\nbeen in the middle of Nepco's harassment, discrimination other issues for\nthe last 18 months. Call me if you have any questions.

Exhibit\nThe WTO Energy Services Coalition booth was a great opportunity to spread the \nword on the goals of ESC.  We manned the booth during the Global Marketplace \n- the name of the exhibition.  We distributed hundreds of the one-pager on \nenergy services, as well as the bound ESC briefing book.  In the time I was \nat the booth there was a significant interest in the ESC.  Thanks to Marc \nEichman for dedicating significant time to managing the booth and to the \nEnron graphics department for the outstanding display.  Below find a photo of \nour display:\nII.  Energy Services Panel: How the Energy Services Industry Can Use Trade \nNegotiating to Secure and Expand Markets\nChair:\nTerry Thorn,  Senior VP, Enron\nPanelists: \nJohn Easton, VP, Int'l Programs, Edison Electric Institute\nIan Miller, President, EDS Global Energy Business\nTim Richards, Sr. Manager, Int'l & Gov't Affairs, GE\nRachel Thompson, Administrator, Trade Directorate, OECD\nAttendance at the panel was impressive with over 40 academic, government \n(officials from the US, Norway, Portugal, Costa Rica, Holland, and Israel) \nand private sector participants - in fact, we had to keep adding more chairs.\nTerry Thorn began the panel with a history of energy services and the future \nof the industry in a liberalized market.  Tim Richards provided a summary of \nGE's view of energy services, outlined the current WTO commitments related to \nenergy services and discussed the issues of defining energy services, \nidentifying barriers, and setting a negotiating approach.  John Easton \noutlined the debate on classification of energy services (goods vs. \nservices).  Ian Miller followed on the classification issue and applied it to \nthe EU (especially the German and French) liberalization experience.  Rachel \nThompson outlined her paper on trade in environmental services.  Rachel went \non to describe her lead in the OECD work program on trade in environmental \nservices with its focus on a win-win approach to trade and environment (this \nis similar the win-win-win approach USTR has adopted).  The OECD work program \non environmental services could easily be adopted for energy services. \nA lively discussion ensued on the following:  the link between environmental \nand energy services, the NAFTA (negative list) negotiating strategies, \nchallenges of definition and classification, and e-commerce effect on energy \nservices.\nTerry suggested that interested persons attending the panel provide him \ncontact information so we can create a global network on energy services.  We \ncan do this independently or through the CSI Global Services Network, which \nis an informal, private sector-led on-line community dedicated to \nliberalization of services (we can start a sector specific network).\nThanks to all the panelists for your time and talent in making the panel such \na success.\nPlease see Terry's and Tim's panel presentations attached below:\nWSC Plenary\nOn Tuesday morning all the sector specific panelists chairs presented the \npanel recommendation to the WSC Plenary.  Each chair was given 3 minutes to \npresent its recommendation and 4 Gov't representatives then responded.  The \nrecommendations will be collected and presented to the trade ministers in \nadvance of Seattle.\nIn addition to energy services, recommendations were delivered on e-commerce, \nbanking, insurance, entertainment, transportation, China, accounting, legal \nservices, and express delivery.\nTerry Thorn delivered the ESC recommendation.  Attached below are Terry's \ntranscribed comments to the Plenary and the official panel recommendation.  \nThe government responses were as follows:\nStuart Harbinson, Permanent Rep. of Hong Kong to the WTO and Chairman of the \nWTO Council on Trade in Services: \nAny guidelines on energy services must be general in nature.  \nIndustry must move thoroughly make the case to its respective governments to \nraise energy services as a priority. \n Gov't of Hong Kong will focus on Energy Services.\nJoseph Papovich, Assistant USTR, Services, Investment & Intellectual \nProperty: \nEnergy Services are now in need of further analytical work supported by the \nprivate sector.  \nEnergy Services are similar to telecommunication and could be negotiated \naccordingly.  \nNote of caution:  attempts to liberalize energy services will be derailed if \ncountries (often developing countries) view this as a mandate for gov'ts to \nprivatize energy assets.  Instead, it should encourage open and transparent \nregulatory processes when privatization occurs.\nU.S. supports including energy services in the services round.\nKatsuhiro Nakagawa, Special Advisor, Ministry of Int'l Trade and Industry, \nJapan: \nJapan is currently deregulating its energy sector\n A \"primitive\" debate needs to occur on defining electricity as good vs. \nservice\nResource limitations and environmental aspects will be important to Japanese \nnegotiation.\nIn summary, I believe we made significant movement on mobilizing global \nallies in our efforts.  Numerous colleagues commented on how impressed they \nwere in our raising energy services to such a level of interest in such a \nshort time and many acknowledged Joe Hillings' outstanding leadership of the \nESC.  Thanks to all for making the World Services Congress a success.\nPlease contact me with any questions or concerns.",

LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH\nTIMES STAFF WRITERS\n07/10/2001\nLos Angeles Times\nHome Edition\nB-1\nCopyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company\nSACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. \nDuring the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.\nAmong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. \nIn fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. \nThe figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. \nDavis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. \n\"You have to look at the whole picture,\" Maviglio said. \n\"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,\" he said. \"Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.\" \nThe report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. \nThe records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. \nOscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. \"All the prices were high,\" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. \nThe average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. \nIn the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. \nBy contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. \nA spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the \"vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts.\" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. \nA spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. \nMore Power Bought Than Projected \nHidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. \nStill, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. \nHidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. \nThe reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. \nA summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with \"moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.\"\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Mr. Cobb's\nreport did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did not\ndesignate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend his\ndeposition.  We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail.\n     Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and\ndamage issues is being deposed in San Francisco.  Roland has a scheduling\nconflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt.  The subject on which we want to\nask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the\ninitial offering.  This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, and\nJonathan is on top of it.\n     I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath.  Gerry\nworked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than he\nthought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report.  He is\nvery focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30\ndays.  I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his best\neffort going forward.  I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly.\n     Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to\ninterrogatories from us.  It is much ado about nothing.  We just want to deal\nwith it in the least expensive way.\n     Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, including\nin CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee\nconversations.  My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff,\nand Natwest is trying to limit their losses.\n     We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. \nIt is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. \nThe problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (pro\nrata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common law\ndoctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault.\n The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against\nECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation causes of action.  How all of this works together is\nvirtually uncharted.\n     With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of the\ndefendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for a\ndetermination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of the\ncurrent pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial.  If Enron goes\nto trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs could\ncollect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other\ndefendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whether\nsuch shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault.  We are working on a\nmemorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you.  I think you will\nfind that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we can\nget the price low enough.)\nSteve Howard\nAlschuler Grossman Stein & Kahan LLP\nphone: 310-407-7613\nfax: 310-552-6077\ncell:  213-716-0536\ne-mail:  showard@agsk.com\n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                             \n................................................\nALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN & KAHAN LLP\nATTORNEYS AT LAW\nwww.agsk.com\n2049 Century Park East\nThirty-Ninth Floor\nLos Angeles, CA 90067-3213\nTel 310-277-1226\nFax 310-552-6077\nThis transmission is intended only for the use\nof the addressee and may contain information\nthat is privileged, confidential and exempt from\ndisclosure under applicable law.

Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. \nApproximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.\nHere's some individual comments:\nCatherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to \"help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record\".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.\nSam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.\nArnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying \"show me\" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  \nRory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. \nCarl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.\nGlen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  \nJudy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.\nEd GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said \"FERC--just get it done\"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.\nOther Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.\nFrom the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the \"there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...\"\nCall me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.

There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.\nWe can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.\nWe need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.\nI also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.\nDonna, Victor,\nI like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.

Privately, he is even more outspoken.\nVince\n---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 12/17/99 \n03:08 PM ---------------------------\nVKaminski@aol.com on 12/12/99 11:41:09 AM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: (no subject)\n W ASHINGTON -- Joseph E. Stiglitz said Wednesday that he would\n     resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position\n     for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the\n     effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.\n     Stiglitz, who joined the World Bank in February 1997 after serving\n     as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers,\n     said he would leave the bank at the end of the year and would soon\n     return to his academic post at Stanford University.\n     His departure will remove from Washington perhaps the most\n     outspoken voice in the debate over how rich countries can best aid\n     economic development in poor and crisis-afflicted nations. Over the\n     last two years in particular, Stiglitz had antagonized officials at\n     the International Monetary Fund and within the Clinton\n     administration by criticizing their response to the financial\n     crisis in Asia and their strategy for encouraging the development\n     of democratic capitalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet\n     Union.\n     Stiglitz said the decision to leave had been his. Treasury\n     Secretary Lawrence Summers praised Stiglitz as a \"major creative\n     and intellectual force,\" and administration officials said the\n     United States had not sought Stiglitz's removal. Caroline Anstey, a\n     spokeswoman for the World Bank, said Stiglitz had \"absolutely not\"\n     been forced out, and the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn,\n     praised Stiglitz for having helped to move the institution \"away\n     from the so-called Washington consensus.\"\n     But Wolfensohn has suggested in the past that Stiglitz was too\n     quick to second-guess the international aid agencies and the big\n     industrial nations that control them. \"I think that his recent\n     things about Russia, in my judgment, are not wholly correct,\"\n     Wolfensohn said during the bank's annual meeting this autumn. \"I\n     think to stand back later and say, 'If you'd done it my way\n     everything would have been different,' is a little generous to\n     yourself.\"\n     Stiglitz made no secret Wednesday of feeling constrained in his\n     ability to speak out as freely as he wished. He said he was looking\n     forward to the unfettered freedom of expression afforded by his\n     return to the academic world.\n     \"Whenever you're in an organization there are some pressures,\"\n     Stiglitz said in an interview. \"I felt that it was important for my\n     intellectual integrity to be able to express myself as forcefully\n     as I thought was appropriate.\"\n     A liberal with a strong belief that governments and institutions\n     have a significant role to play in economic development and that\n     market forces cannot be counted on to deal with every problem,\n     Stiglitz challenged the prevailing orthodoxy among policy makers in\n     Washington.\n     He said that the monetary fund went overboard in Asia in demanding\n     that the countries ensnared in the financial crisis cut their\n     budgets, arguing that fiscal austerity sometimes extracted too high\n     a price from poor people without generating a corresponding\n     improvement in international economic confidence.\n     He took issue with the view held by the fund and the U.S.\n     government that controls on the international flow of capital were\n     counterproductive or impractical, saying that in some cases it was\n     justified to restrict short-term flows of money in and out of a\n     developing economy. He said industrialized countries sometimes\n     pushed developing nations too fast to deregulate their financial\n     systems.\n     He suggested that the United States and the monetary fund had\n     failed to acknowledge that their prescription for Russia -- quick\n     privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight\n     of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to\n     the rest of the world -- had not produced the intended results and\n     indeed had left many people worse off.\n     \"Stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the\n     excluded, and he's been one of the best things in the World Bank in\n     the last decade,\" said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, which\n     promotes poverty-fighting policies. \"He's also been very pointed\n     and insightful in discussing the role of the IMF. We're not used to\n     that kind of candor.\"\n     Stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at the\n     Treasury Department and the monetary fund. But his message was\n     greeted enthusiastically in poor countries, and he said he was\n     leaving the bank feeling that he had helped to stimulate a more\n     vigorous debate about the policy prescriptions that wealthy nations\n     impose on developing countries.\n     \"On some of the specific issues, there has emerged really a broad\n     consensus behind the views I took,\" Stiglitz said.\n     \"There's a recognition that policies in East Asia were excessively\n     contractionary on the fiscal side,\" he continued. \"There's a\n     recognition that capital market liberalization, in the absence of\n     adequate regulatory structures, exposes countries to much higher\n     risks. And on the debate about economies in transition, there's a\n     general consensus that the issues I've been raising are the right\n     issues, and that while no one has the answers, we're not going to\n     get answers until we're willing to ask the questions.\"\n     Stiglitz had told friends recently that he intended to leave, and\n     he informed Wolfensohn Wednesday morning of his decision.\n     Wolfensohn said Stiglitz would continue to act as an adviser to him\n     and Stiglitz would lead the search for a new chief economist.\n     Ms. Anstey, the bank's spokeswoman, said that asking Stiglitz to\n     head the search committee was a signal of the institution's\n     \"intention to select someone who will continue the\n     Wolfensohn-Stiglitz agenda\" of focusing more on the needs of poor\n     countries and less on more orthodox policies developed in\n     Washington.\n     Stiglitz said his approach was built around two basic themes:\n     giving more of a voice to poor nations in setting policy and\n     recognizing the crucial role that government must play in economic\n     development.\n     \"We are rebalancing our thinking about the role of the state,\"\n     Stiglitz said. \"Some of the failures, like in East Asia, involve\n     cases where government did too little, like in financial\n     regulation, rather than too much.\"",
